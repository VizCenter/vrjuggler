      The name of this chunk is also the file name of the file to be
      included.  This is a string value, and as the name of a file, it 
      depends upon the underlying file system for its syntax. On UNIX, 
      file names are case sensitive, and directories are separated
      by the `/' character. On Win32-based systems, file names are not case 
      sensitive, and directories are separated by the `\' character.
      <p>
      File names can be prefixed with the strings <TT>$HOME</TT> or
      <TT>$VJ_BASE_DIR</TT>.  These strings will be replaced with the
      user's home directory and the VR Juggler install directory, respectively.
      For example, a name might be ``<TT>$HOME/myapp/myapp.desc</TT>''.
      <p>
      File names in vjIncludeDescFile chunks may be relative pathnames (e.g. 
      ``../foo.desc'').  <i>The name is relative to the location of the 
      file that contains the vjIncludeDescFile chunk</i>.
