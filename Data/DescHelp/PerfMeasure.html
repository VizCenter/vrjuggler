      Chunk token: ``<TT>PerfMeasure</TT>''<BR>
      A chunk that controls activation of VR Juggler performance measurements.

      Property token: ``<TT>TimingTests</TT>''<BR>
      This property can include a number of lines detailing whether certain
      performance tests should be active or inactive.  Each line contains
      a string identifier and a boolean value - true to enable, false to
      disable.
      <p>
      The string identifiers are names of different classes of performance
      data.  For example, the current beta includes a Juggler kernel
      test - ``<TT>Kernel</TT>'' and an OpenGL rendering pipe test -
      ``<TT>vjGlPipe</TT>''.
      <p>
      Any test in Juggler which does not have an entry in the Performance
      Measurements chunk (or any test at all if there is no chunk in the 
      current configuration) defaults to being inactive.
      <p>
      The performance tests in the beta release are geared towards analyzing
      the performance of the Juggler library itself.  The next release will
      feature tests better suited to analyzing performance issue of 
      applications.
