      Chunk token: ``FileConnect''<br>
      Defines an output (or, in the future, input) file for the VR Juggler
      Environment Manager.  Its most common use is to define a file which
      can be used as a destination for performance measurement data.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">
      <b>File Name</b>
    </td>
    <td>
      Gives the pathname for this file.  Exactly what constitutes a valid
      name depends on the underlying file system.  On Unix systems, this
      might be something like "output_data" or
      "<tt>~cjust/tmp/perfdata.txt</tt>".

    <td>
      For any EM Connection you are creating for a config file, this should
      be "Output".  Internally, Juggler has some
      ability to read instructions from files or sockets.  In the future, this
      may also allow the use of input instruction files.
