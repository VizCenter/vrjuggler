VjControl Preferences</H2>

VjControl has a number of user-configurable options.  These can be
accessed from "Preferences" in the Options menu.  "Edit Preferences"
brings up a window to (surprise) edit the preferences.  This is the
same as the usual window used for editing ConfigChunks.

<p>
The "Save Preferences" option saves the current preferences to the
file <tt>~/.vjconfig/vjcontrol.cfg</tt> , where they will be loaded
from the next time vjcontrol starts.

<p>
Note that the <tt>vjcontrol.cfg</tt> file is a standard VR Juggler
config file, and so it can also be loaded and edited in vjcontrol's
Configure panel (though doing this won't change the current preferences).

<p>
<h3>VjControl Preference Options:</h3>

<ul>
<li><h4>Look and Feel</h4> - this can be used to change the overall
"look and feel" of the GUI, using the Java Swing classes.  The 
possible options are: Java (the default), Motif, Windows, and Macintosh.
Note that the Windows and Mac look-and-feels are only available when 
running on their respective platforms.
<p>
Most of the differences between look-and-feels are cosmetic, but you
may wish to experiment.  The Windows L&F appears to perform better than
Java under W98/NT.  The Java L&F has been most extensively tested.

<p>
<li><h4>Default Host and Default Port</h4> - These are the default host name
and port number that will appear in the Connections panel.

<li><h4>Preload ChunkDesc Files</h4> - Here you can specify one or more
Chunk Description files that will be loaded automatically when vjcontrol
starts up.  The arguments are simply pathnames to files.  If the strings
"VJ_BASE_DIR" or "HOME" are included in a path name, they will be replaced
with the value of the $VJ_BASE_DIR environment variable or the user's
home directory, respectively.

<p>
It is suggested that you include <tt>VJ_BASE_DIR/share/Data/chunksDesc</tt>, the
main Chunk Description file.

<p>
You can override the automatic loading of files at startup by using the 
-noautoload <a href="cmdline.html">command-line argument</a>.

<li><h4>Preload Configuration Files</h4> - This lets you specify one or more
Configuration files to load at startup (The details are similar to the
option above).
<p>

<li><h4>Font Name and Font Size</h4> - This specifies the name and size of
font to use for all of vjcontrol's windows.  Note that currently only a 
small number of fonts are available (this is a limitation of JDK 1.1,
and will be fixed at a later date).
