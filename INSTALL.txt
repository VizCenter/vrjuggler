Introduction

   You have downloaded the source code for Version 1.1 of the Juggler
   Project. This is the code that will become VR Juggler 2.0, and it is the
   code that is used to create the VR juggler 2.0 pre-releases. Please be
   aware that this code represents a work in progress, and if you acquired it
   directly from CVS rather than using a pre-packaged source code snapshot,
   the code may have bugs affecting compilation and execution.

   This document explains how to build the modules of the Juggler Project
   from the source code. We begin by explaining some issues related to
   specific operating systems. We then explain how to get the source code
   from our CVS repository. (Those users who downloaded a pre-packaged source
   release can skip ahead to the section called "Using configure.pl"). We
   conclude with instructions on how to build VR Juggler and its individual
   components.

   Before reading further, we recommend that readers take a look at the Wiki
   page relating to building from CVS
   (http://www.vrjuggler.org/twiki_public/bin/view/Juggler/BuildingFromCvs).
   It is a supplement to this document containing tips and reminders for
   those users building the CVS version of VR Juggler. It is not a
   replacement for this document, nor can it stand on its own as build
   instructions. You are reading the definitive build instructions; the Wiki
   page merely provides informal, extra information.

  Important Notes for IRIX Users

   Despite our best efforts, there are some issues related to compiling the
   Juggler Project on IRIX. We introduce them in this section and explain how
   to work around them.

    Perl Version

   There are many Perl scripts used as part of getting, configuring, and
   building the Juggler Suite of tools. In particular, two scripts required
   for compiling need Perl 5.005 or newer. The version of Perl that ships
   with IRIX 6.5 is very old (circa 1997) and does not work with many Perl
   scripts we have written. SGI provides a much newer version of Perl (5.6.1)
   with their freeware tools (http://freeware.sgi.com/). It will be necessary
   to install that version for our scripts to work. This version is typically
   installed as /usr/freeware/bin/perl.

   Once you have a modern Perl installed, you can run various Perl scripts as
   follows:

 /usr/freeware/bin/perl <script-name>

   The above will be required any time a Perl script fails with an error
   similar to the following:

 Perl 5.005 required--this is only version 5.00404, stopped at ./configure.pl line 35.
 BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at ./configure.pl line 35.

   Furthermore, it is highly recommended that the --with-perl argument be
   passed to configure.pl. This argument gives all the Autoconf-based
   configure scripts a hint about where the preferred version of Perl lives.
   If using /usr/freeware/bin/perl to run configure.pl, we recommend that the
   configure.pl command line appear similar to the following:

 /usr/freeware/bin/perl configure.pl --with-perl=/usr/freeware/bin

   Note that the value given to --with-perl is the directory where the perl
   executable can be found. The configure scripts will add this directory to
   the front of the search path when trying to find a suitable perl
   executable. Once it is found, all the Perl scripts used for configuration,
   compilation, and installation will use that executable.

   To simplify command execution somewhat, it can help to have
   /usr/freeware/bin (or whatever path is appropriate) in your path before
   /bin or /usr/bin or any of the other myriad directories where Perl might
   exist on IRIX. In such a situation, none of the above extra steps should
   be necessary. The correct version of Perl will be found simply by virtue
   of it being early in your path.

    MIPSpro Compiler Version

   Reports have been made on the VR Juggler mailing list regarding compile
   failures (including segmentation faults within the compiler) occur when
   using the MIPSpro Compilers Version 7.3.1.1m. We have found upgrading to
   Version 7.3.1.3m (or newer) fixes the problems.

   A new feature of VR Juggler 1.1 is support for GCC on IRIX. Users who do
   not have MIPSpro or cannot upgrade can compile and run VR Juggler (without
   OpenGL Performer support) using the version of GCC distributed by SGI. It
   can be downloaded from http://freeware.sgi.com/index-by-alpha.html for
   free. When configuring the source with configure.pl (described later), use
   the option --with-gcc.

  Important Note for Win32 Users

   VR Juggler 1.1 uses a lot of C++ templates. Some components of the system
   will not compile with MS Visual Studio 6.0, and as a result, we currently
   require the use of Visual Studio 7 (.NET) to compile the source code. We
   understand that this is an inconvenience, and we are interested in methods
   for compiling the code with Visual Studio 6. However, due to VC6's poor
   support for templates and the C++ standard in general, users need to be
   aware that it may not be possible.

Getting the Source Code and the Dependencies

   In this section, we explain how to get the Juggler Project source code and
   the dependencies required to build Juggler. There are two ways to get the
   source code: from a pre-packaged source release archive or from the CVS
   repository on SourceForge. If you got the code from a pre-packaged source
   archive, that code is a complete "snapshot" of the CVS repository at the
   time of release. It contains all dependencies that would otherwise have
   been acquired using CVS. It does not contain binary dependencies that must
   be downloaded separately (such as NSPR, the Java Developer Kit, a C++
   compiler, etc.).

   The current list of required software packages is as follows:

     o CppDOM (http://www.sf.net/projects/xml-cppdom/): A lightweight,
       easy-to-use XML parser written in C++. CppDOM must be compiled and
       installed for use with VR Juggler.

     o Boost (http://www.boost.org/): A C++ library providing many powerful
       utility classes and libraries. Boost must be compiled and installed
       for use with VR Juggler.

     o GMTL (http://ggt.sf.net/): A generic math library that makes use of
       C++ templates and STL paradigms. GMTL must be installed for use with
       VR Juggler.

   The following lists semi-optional packages:

     o NSPR (http://www.mozilla.org/projects/nspr/): The Netscape Portable
       Runtime, which can be used by VPR for threading and sockets (required
       on Win32, Solaris, and Mac OS X).

     o Java Developer Kit (http://java.sun.com/): The J2SE SDK (or JDK) is
       used to compile all the Java code used in the Juggler Project. Without
       it, none of the Java code can be built. We require version 1.3 or
       newer; we recommend version 1.4 or newer. The Java Standard Edition
       (J2SE) can be downloaded from http://java.sun.com/j2se/.

     o OpenORB (http://openorb.sourceforge.net/): A pure Java implementation
       of CORBA 2.3, required for the Tweek Java GUI if you are using a
       version of the JDK older than 1.4.0.

     o omniORB (http://omniorb.sourceforge.net/): A C++ implementation of
       CORBA 2.3, required for the Tweek C++ API.

   In the following subsections, we describe how to get all of the above
   except Boost, CppDOM, the JDK, OpenORB, omniORB, and NSPR. These must be
   downloaded individually from the sites listed above. You may also have to
   compile one or more of the packages if binary distributions are not
   available. Which packages you download depends on what you already have
   installed. Note carefully which packages are needed based on the software
   you have installed and what versions of tools (such as the JDK) that you
   download.

  How to Get the Juggler Suite from CVS

   You can optionally get the Juggler Project as a source code tarball from
   the website (http://www.vrjuggler.org/) or you can execute the following
   commands from a shell to get the code from our CVS repository:

 cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.vrjuggler.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/vrjuggler login
 cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.vrjuggler.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/vrjuggler co juggler

  Downloading Binary Dependencies

   In addition to source the dependencies acquired through CVS, there are
   some third-party dependencies that must be installed separately. Remember
   that no Java code in VR Juggler can be used without the JDK and a working
   Java version of CORBA (either from OpenORB, JacORB, or the JDK itself).

    Boost

   The minimum required version of Boost, as of this writing, is 1.31.0. The
   Boost source can be downloaded from http://www.sf.net/projects/boost/. To
   compile and install Boost, refer to its installation documentation
   (http://www.boost.org/more/getting_started.html#Build_Install). Note that
   you need the command bjam (referred to as "boost-jam" on the Boost
   download page) to build Boost.

    CppDOM

   For XML processing, we use CppDOM 0.3.2 or newer. The source and binary
   distributions for some platforms can be downloaded from
   http://www.sf.net/projects/xml-cppdom/. If a binary version is not
   available for your operating system you must compile and install CppDOM
   yourself. Note that you need SCons (http://scons.sourceforge.net/) to
   build and install CppDOM.

    GMTL

   For high-level mathematical operations, we use GMTL 0.3.2 or newer. The
   source distribution can be downloaded from
   http://www.sf.net/projects/ggt/. Note that you need SCons
   (http://scons.sourceforge.net/) to build and install GMTL.

    Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR)

   Our operating system abstraction, VPR, can make use of NSPR for operating
   system primitives. On some platforms (IRIX, FreeBSD, Linux), the use of
   NSPR is strictly optional. On others (Win32, Mac OS X, and Solaris), it is
   required. Based on your local system, you should decide whether you need
   NSPR. Binary versions of NSPR can be downloaded from
   ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/nspr/releases. At this time, we
   recommend the use of version 4.2 or newer.

    Java Developer Kit (also called the J2SE SDK)

   We make use of the Java programming language in addition to C++. Java is
   used exclusively for GUIs such as Tweek and VRJConfig (which is a JavaBean
   that is loaded into Tweek). To compile the Java code, a JDK is necessary.
   We currently require version 1.3 or newer; we recommend version 1.4 or
   newer. The Java Standard Edition can be downloaded from
   http://java.sun.com/j2se/. More information can be found at
   http://java.sun.com/.

    OpenORB

   OpenORB is a pure-Java implementation of CORBA 2.3. It is required in
   order to compile the Tweek Java API (and hence VRJConfig) if you are using
   a version of the JDK older than 1.4.0. OpenORB 1.3.0 can be downloaded
   from http://openorb.sourceforge.net/.

   There are three JAR files needed to use OpenORB 1.3 with Juggler Project
   code. They are openorb-1.3.0.jar, avalon-framework.jar, and logkit.jar.
   All three come with a standard OpenORB distribution. We will show how to
   tell the configure scripts about these JAR files later.

    omniORB

   omniORB is a C++ implementation of CORBA 2.3. It is required in order to
   compile the Tweek C++ API. At this time, the Tweek C++ API is not required
   for VR Juggler, but this situation will change in the near future. At this
   time, we primarily use omniORB 4.0.x. omniORB can be downloaded from
   http://omniorb.sourceforge.net/.

   omniORB 3.0 has strange conventions for how installations are made. Within
   the bin and lib directories, there are platform-specific subdirectories
   that contain the actual binaries (except when installed on FreeBSD via the
   Ports Collection). Because of this, several extra options must be
   specified in order to tell the Tweek configure script where to find
   everything. Please refer to the section called "Tweek" for more details on
   this.

Compiling

   In this section, we describe how to compile the Juggler Project. We focus
   on VR Juggler as a whole, but information about some of the individual
   components is provided later.

  Important Note Regarding Compiling

   You have downloaded developmental code. It may not be stable, and it may
   not even compile. Compiling VR Juggler itself can be a little complicated
   for anyone who does not have some background in using CVS, Autoconf, C++,
   and make or Visual Studio.

  Compiling the Juggler Suite of Tools

   This section explains how to get, configure, and compile all of the tools
   that make up VR Juggler. Each tool compiles to its own library and can be
   installed individually. (Refer to the README file in this directory for
   more information about the specific modules.)

   To build VR Juggler on Windows, you must use the Visual Studio solution.
   After getting the dependencies needed to compile VR Juggler (see the next
   section), refer to the README.html file located in the vc7 subdirectory of
   this directory. Do not bother to the rest of this document.

    Configuring VR Juggler

   Every time you update the source code acquired from CVS, it is recommended
   that you run autogen.sh. This script is found in the top-level juggler
   directory, and it is run as follows:

 ./autogen.sh

   This autogen.sh script must be run from the directory where it exists. Do
   not try to run it from a build directory or any other place in the Juggler
   source tree. The same holds for the individual autogen.sh scripts in the
   various modules, should you need to run one individually.

      Using configure.pl

   In the base juggler source directory, we have a "global" configure script
   written in Perl called configure.pl. To get the command-line options for
   this script, use one of the following (the second being much more
   detailed):

 ./configure.pl --help
 ./configure.pl --manual

   To configure your system, you will need to see what options all the
   Autoconf-based configure scripts in VR Juggler need. To get this text,
   enter:

 ./configure.pl --all-help

   configure.pl can run in a different "build" directory or in the directory
   where it resides. Here is how we (the Juggler Team) have been using it:

    1. Make a directory for compiling. There are many good reasons to do this
       away from the main source tree (though they will not be listed here).

 mkdir build.linux.posix

       This example using an ad hoc naming convention based on operating
       system and threading subsystem. Other examples could be
       build.irix.sproc, build.solaris.nspr, etc.

    2. Enter the new build directory.

 cd build.linux.posix

    3. Configure all the modules making up VR Juggler. This is when you must
       tell the module configure scripts where all the package dependencies
       are found. For this description, we will use the term <JAVA_ORB_PATH>
       to refer to the installation directory containing a Java-based CORBA
       implementation. Assume that this is an absolute path (e.g.,
       <JAVA_ORB_PATH> = /home/user1/pkgs/openorb). For this example, we will
       use the OpenORB 1.3 JAR file list.

 ../configure.pl --prefix=$HOME/vrjuggler-2.0 --with-java-orb=OpenORB --with-java-orb-jar="<JAVA_ORB_PATH>/lib/openorb-1.3.0.jar:<JAVA_ORB_PATH>/lib/avalon-framework.jar:<JAVA_ORB_PATH>/lib/logkit.jar"

       If you are using JDK 1.4.0 or newer, your command line can be
       simplified to the following:

 ../configure.pl --prefix=$HOME/vrjuggler-2.0 --with-java-orb=JDK

  Note

       You will probably have to specify the paths to your local CppDOM,
       GMTL, and Boost installations using the options --with-cppdom,
       --with-gmtl-prefix and --with-boost unless they are installed in the
       default location (/usr/local). By default, Boost 1.31 installs its
       header files in a subdirectory of include called boost-1_31. That is,
       if Boost is installed in /home/user1/pkgs/boost, the header files will
       be in /home/user1/pkgs/boost/include/boost-1_31. In this case, you
       must also specify the option
       --with-boost-includes=/home/user1/pkgs/boost/include/boost-1_31 when
       running configure.pl.

   By default, the configuration process will configure VR Juggler and all of
   its dependencies. This includes Sonix, which is an interesting special
   case. Sonix can make use of Aaudiere, OpenAL, or AudioWorks to add sound
   to VR Juggler applications. If none of those packages is found, Sonix will
   "stub out" its sound APIs. This means that Sonix and the VR Juggler Sound
   Manager can still be used in applications, but no audio will be heard at
   run time. See the section called "Sonix" for more information about how to
   configure Sonix to use Audiere, OpenAL, or AudioWorks.

   For example uses of configure.pl, take a look at the Wiki page relating to
   building from CVS
   (http://www.vrjuggler.org/twiki_public/bin/view/Juggler/BuildingFromCvs).
   It is not a replacement for this document, but it shows how some members
   of the Juggler team configure VR Juggler. It also has information on more
   advanced uses of configure.pl that are beyond the scope of this document.

      Using Locally Installed Software

   As noted in the section called "Getting the Source Code and the
   Dependencies", VR Juggler depends on several external software packages.
   As an example, consider the case where the GMTL library is installed in
   /home/user1/pkgs/GMTL with the headers in /home/user1/pkgs/GMTL/include.
   To use this installation, run configure.pl as follows:

 ../configure.pl --with-gmtl-prefix=/home/user1/pkgs/GMTL

   The --with-gmtl-prefix option could of course be mixed in with those shown
   in the previous section.

    Compiling VR Juggler

   Once the configuration process is complete, the code can be compiled.
   Remember that we require the use of GNU make 3.78 or newer.

    1. Compile the source tree using GNU make.

 gmake build

    2. Once this completes, you will have a full build of VR Juggler. For
       those who are not interested in developing VR Juggler or its component
       modules, it is recommended that you install the software and use the
       installed version for application development. Do this as follows:

 gmake install

  Tips for Compiling Individual Tools in the Juggler Suite

   In this section, we provide tips for ensuring that individual tools in the
   Juggler Suite are compiled correctly. For the most part, this duplicates
   information that can be found on the Wiki page relating to building from
   CVS
   (http://www.vrjuggler.org/twiki_public/bin/view/Juggler/BuildingFromCvs).

    Sonix

   Sonix wraps other audio subsystems such as OpenAL (www.openal.org),
   Audiere (audiere.sf.net), or AudioWorks (multigen.com). At least one of
   these packages must be installed for use by Sonix in order to hear sounds
   in VR Juggler applications. Once you have all the necessary source code
   and third-party package installations, add one or more of the following
   options to your configure.pl command line to enable the appropriate audio
   subsystem:

     o --enable-openal --with-openal=<OPENAL_PATH>: Enable the use of OpenAL
       and tell the build where OpenAL is installed. The default search path
       is /usr/local.

     o --enable-audiere --with-audiere=<AUDIERE_PATH>: Enable the use of
       Audiere and tell the build where Audiere is installed. The default
       search path is /usr/local.

     o --enable-audioworks --with-audioworks=<AUDIOWORKS_PATH>: Enable the
       use of AudioWorks and tell the build where AudioWorks is installed.
       The default search path is /usr.

  Note

   AudioWorks and OpenAL cannot be compiled together. They depend on mutually
   exclusive VPR threading subsystems. Warnings will be printed by the Sonix
   configure script indicating this fact. OpenAL and Audiere can be compiled
   together, however.

    Tweek

   Tweek needs JDK 1.3.1 or newer and the third-party CORBA implementations
   omniORB 3.0.4 or newer (C++) and OpenORB 1.2.0 or newer (Java). These
   packages can be downloaded from the following websites:

     o omniORB: http://www.omniorb.org/ or http://omniorb.sourceforge.net/

     o OpenORB: http://openorb.sourceforge.net/

   Remember that a separate Java implementation of CORBA is only required if
   you are using a version of the JDK older than 1.4.0.

   For the following steps, assume that you have omniORB installed in
   <OMNIORB_PATH> and OpenORB is installed in <OPENORB_PATH>.

   IRIX users must configure Tweek (and its VPR dependency) to use the POSIX
   subsystem or the NSPR subsystem. omniORB will not work with SPROC threads.
   To configure VPR to use either POSIX threads or NSPR threads, pass either
   --enable-subsystem=POSIX or --enable-subsystem=NSPR respectively to
   configure.pl.

   Assuming you have the external packages installed, do the following from
   the top-level juggler directory:

 mkdir build
 cd build
 ../configure.pl --with-cxx-orb=omniORB4 --with-cxx-orb-root=<OMNIORB_PATH> --with-java-orb=OpenORB --with-java-orb-jar=<OPENORB_PATH>/lib/openorb-1.2.0.jar
 gmake build install

   If JDK 1.4.0 or newer is used, you do not need OpenORB (or any other
   third-party CORBA implementation for Java). In that case, pass
   --with-java-orb=JDK to configure.pl and remove the --with-java-orb-jar
   option. If you are using omniORB 3.x, pass --with-cxx-orb=omniORB3
   instead.

   Depending on your omniORB installation, you may have to pass extra
   arguments to configure.pl so that the configuration process can find the
   omniidl binary and the omniORB libraries. For example, on Red Hat Linux
   7.2 with omniORB 3.0.x, the following arguments must be specified in
   addition to the above:

 --with-cxx-orb-bin=<OMNIORB_PATH>/bin/i586_linux_2.0_glibc --with-cxx-orb-lib=<OMNIORB_PATH>/lib/i586_linux_2.0_glibc
