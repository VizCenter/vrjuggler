===============================================================================

 Version: 1.0.0

    * Performer with POSIX threads is known to be unstable on IRIX.  This is
      a known issue with the OpenGL Performer library.
    * 2.96 versions of GCC are known to be unstable on Linux.  In particular,
      the default compiler on RedHat 7.0 will not compile VR Juggler at all.
      With the 2.96.69 upgrade, OpenGL applications will work, but
      Performer-based applications fail dynamic_cast due to problems.
    * The IBox driver does not currently support analog input.
