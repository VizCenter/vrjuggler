                           VR Juggler Release Notes
                           ------------------------

For all versions:

    - See the ChangeLog for more system-level changes that do not directly
      affect applications.
    - See the Known Bugs page on the VR Juggler website (www.vrjuggler.org)
      for the current list of bugs.

===============================================================================

 Version: 0.1.97
Released: July 18, 2000

    Required application and configuration changes for upgrading from 0.1.95:
        * Link Juggler_utils
        * Keyboard chunk in config files should have sleep_time set to a
          non-zero value.  50 is a reasonable value.  Failing to do so can
          result in a major perforamnce decrease.
        * All windows are positioned with a coordinate system based at the
          lower left corner of the window relative to the lower left corner
          of the display.  Full screen windows should be placed at 0,0.
        * vjGetVJMatrix() (in Kernel/Pf/vjPfUtil.h) been renamed to
          vjGetVjMatrix().

    New features:
        * Debugging output can be color coded for easier readbility.  This
          is currently only availble with the UNIX versions.
        * Many bug fixes that include fixing some bad memory references.
        * Pinch glove driver is now supported and has a digital simulator.
        * MotionStar driver is working but still has some limitations (see
          the Known Bugs page).
        * The samples/pf directory has a VR Juggler application to load
          models into Performer that supports nagivation and collision
          detection.
        * The vjMatrix class has three new members for getting rotation
          values: getXRot(), getYRot() and getZRot().
        * Applications no longer need to pass a kernel instance to their
          VR Juggler App super class.  The vjApp class will get a vjKernel
          instance on its own if none is provided.  If, however, a kernel
          instance is provided and it is NULL, a fatal error will still
          occur.
        * SoundManager is available to abstract sound functionality for 
          cross platform audio.

    VjControl now requires the Java 2 compiler and runtime environment.
