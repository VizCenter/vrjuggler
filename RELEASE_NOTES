                           ------------------------

For all versions:

    - See the ChangeLog for more system-level changes that do not directly
      affect applications.
    - See the Known Bugs page on the VR Juggler website (www.vrjuggler.org)
      for the current list of bugs.

 Version: 1.0.3
Released: November 26, 2001

    Major bug fixes:
        * The helper function vjGetVjMatrix() did not convert a pfMatrix to
          a vjMatrix correctly.
        * A memory bug in the low-level MotionStar driver has been patched.
        * VjControl works with JDK 1.4.
        * The vjMatrix constructor that initializes the matrix elements
          individually assigns all values correctly.
        * Shared libraries can be built on HP-UX 11.x.

===============================================================================

 Version: 1.0.2
Released: August 6, 2001

    Major bug fixes:
        * The config chunk for TrackdSensor and TrackdController have been
          fixed so that the min and max settings are correctly associated
          with TrackdController.
        * Linking errors related to the use of pthread_attr_setstackaddr()
          on newer versions of Linux have been fixed.
        * Redraw problems in VjControl related to updating the active
          application configuration have been fixed.

===============================================================================

 Version: 1.0.1
Released: June 14, 2001

    Major bug fixes:
        * The MotionStar driver has had several bugs fixed.  In particular,
          it can now recover when the server system is in a bad state.

    New features:
        * Support for HP-UX 11.00.

===============================================================================

 Version: 1.0.0
Released: April 13, 2001

    Required application and configuration changes for upgrading from older
    beta versions:
        * Interocular distance is now a configurable option.  If not given,
          the default separation will be 0.0 which results in no stereo
          viewing.  A recommended value for most cases is 0.229.  This is
          set in the JugglerUser chunk.
        * Link Juggler_utils when compiling applications.
        * The method vjQuat::unit() is now called vjQuat::normalizeFast().
        * The method vjQuat::makeQuat() is now called vjQuat::makeRot().
        * Update the descfiles property in ~/.vjconfig/vjcontrol.cfg (if one
          exists) to point to "$VJ_SHARE_DIR/Data/chunksDesc".  This is
          necessary because the extra VR Juggler files are now installed in
          $VJ_BASE_DIR/share by default instead of $VJ_BASE_DIR.  Note that
          $VJ_SHARE_DIR is a value used internally by VjControl and does
          not have to be set as an environment variable.
        * On IRIX with the MIPSpro Compilers, -LANG:std must be added to the
          compiler and linker options for compiling applications.
        * On IRIX, the version 7.3.1.1m or newer of the MIPSpro Compilers is
          required.  Check your version with 'CC -version' on the command
          line.
        * The Ascension MotionStar driver has been improved, and configuration
          files for that device must be updated.  Refer to the examples in
          $VJ_BASE_DIR/share/Data/configFiles/example.mstar.1pack.config and
          $VJ_BASE_DIR/share/Data/configFiles/example.mstar.2pack.config for
          one- and two-pack configurations respectively.
        * All windows are positioned relative to the lower left corner of
          the display area.  This allows all graphics APIs on all platforms
          to use the same display configuration.

    New features:
        * The field of view (FOV) and aspect ratio can now be configured in
          simulator windows.
        * Drivers for trackd and the Intersense IS-900 have been added.
        * Many memory problems and instability issues have been fixed.
        * Win32 support has been improved.  All windows are positioned
          correctly, and borderless surface displays can be opened.

===============================================================================

 Version: 0.1.97
Released: July 18, 2000

    Required application and configuration changes for upgrading from 0.1.95:
        * Link Juggler_utils
        * Keyboard chunk in config files should have sleep_time set to a
          non-zero value.  50 is a reasonable value.  Failing to do so can
          result in a major perforamnce decrease.
        * All windows are positioned with a coordinate system based at the
          lower left corner of the window relative to the lower left corner
          of the display.  Full screen windows should be placed at 0,0.
        * vjGetVJMatrix() (in Kernel/Pf/vjPfUtil.h) been renamed to
          vjGetVjMatrix().

    New features:
        * Debugging output can be color coded for easier readbility.  This
          is currently only availble with the UNIX versions.
        * Many bug fixes that include fixing some bad memory references.
        * Pinch glove driver is now supported and has a digital simulator.
        * MotionStar driver is working but still has some limitations (see
          the Known Bugs page).
        * The samples/pf directory has a VR Juggler application to load
          models into Performer that supports nagivation and collision
          detection.
        * The vjMatrix class has three new members for getting rotation
          values: getXRot(), getYRot() and getZRot().
        * Applications no longer need to pass a kernel instance to their
          VR Juggler App super class.  The vjApp class will get a vjKernel
          instance on its own if none is provided.  If, however, a kernel
          instance is provided and it is NULL, a fatal error will still
          occur.
        * SoundManager is available to abstract sound functionality for 
          cross platform audio.

    VjControl now requires the Java 2 compiler and runtime environment.
