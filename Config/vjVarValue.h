/** A vjVarValue is an object that knows it's own type even if we don't.
 *  More seriously, it's the value storage unit and value return type
 *  for a ConfigChunk.
 *  Currently, vjVarValues can be of types int, FLOAT, boolean, string
 *  (char*), distance(essentially FLOAT), as defined by the VarType
 *  enumeration in vjVarValue.h.
 *  When you get a vjVarValue, you can do just a few things with it:
 *    1. assign it to a variable and then use it.  Note that there is
 *       type checking here: if you try assigning a string vjVarValue to
 *       an int, you'll get an error.
 *    2. Cast it to the right type and use it.  
 *    3. print it - vjVarValues have overloaded << so you can print them
 *       without having to cast to the right value.
 *  Note that it's generally incumbent upon the client to know what
 *  kind of vjVarValue he's getting and what it can do.  Hey, you're
 *  the one who queryed the ConfigChunk, not me.

  /* general question of using objects in here.
   * we have to actually store the objects as pointers, in order
   * to be able to use classes that have constructors inside
   * the union.
   * When should we copy?  Seems like the objects we store should
   * be fresh copies of whatever's given to us, and probably so 
   * should the objects we return, just for safety's sake.
   * would it be ok to receive and return pointers to objects?
   * What objects would we need to store? mebbe a string class?
