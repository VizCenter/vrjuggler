    Project. This is the code that will become VR Juggler 2.0, and it is the
    code that is used to create the VR juggler 2.0 pre-releases. Please be
    aware that this code represents a work in progress, and if you acquired it
    directly from CVS rather than using a pre-packaged source code snapshot,
    the code may have bugs affecting compilation and execution.</p><p>This document explains how to build the modules of the Juggler
    Project from the source code. We begin by explaining some issues related
    to specific operating systems. We then explain how to get the source code
    from our CVS repository. (Those users who downloaded a pre-packaged source
    release can skip ahead to <a href="#using.configure.pl" title="Using configure.pl">the section called &#8220;Using <span><strong class="command">configure.pl</strong></span>&#8221;</a>). We
    conclude with instructions on how to build VR Juggler and its individual
    components.</p><p>Before reading further, we recommend that readers take a look at the
    Wiki page relating to building from CVS (<a href="http://www.vrjuggler.org/twiki_public/bin/view/Juggler/BuildingFromCvs" target="_top">http://www.vrjuggler.org/twiki_public/bin/view/Juggler/BuildingFromCvs</a>).
    It is a <span class="emphasis"><em>supplement</em></span> to this document containing tips
    and reminders for those users building the CVS version of VR Juggler. It
    is not a replacement for this document, nor can it stand on its own as
    build instructions. You are reading the definitive build instructions; the
    Wiki page merely provides informal, extra information.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e32"></a>Important Notes for IRIX Users</h3></div></div></div><p>Despite our best efforts, there are some issues related to
      compiling the Juggler Project on IRIX. We introduce them in this section
      and explain how to work around them.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e37"></a>Perl Version</h4></div></div></div><p>There are many Perl scripts used as part of getting,
        configuring, and building the Juggler Suite of tools. In particular,
        two scripts required for compiling need Perl 5.005 or newer. The
        version of Perl that ships with IRIX 6.5 is very old (circa 1997) and
        does not work with many Perl scripts we have written. SGI provides a
        much newer version of Perl (5.6.1) with their freeware tools (<a href="http://freeware.sgi.com/" target="_top">http://freeware.sgi.com/</a>). It
        will be necessary to install that version for our scripts to work.
        This version is typically installed as
        <code class="filename">/usr/freeware/bin/perl</code>.</p><p>Once you have a modern Perl installed, you can run various Perl
        scripts as follows:</p><pre class="screen">/usr/freeware/bin/perl &lt;script-name&gt;</pre><p>The above will be required any time a Perl script fails with an
        error similar to the following:</p><pre class="screen">Perl 5.005 required--this is only version 5.00404, stopped at ./configure.pl line 35.
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at ./configure.pl line 35.</pre><p>Furthermore, it is highly recommended that the
        <code class="option">--with-perl</code> argument be passed to
        <span><strong class="command">configure.pl</strong></span>. This argument gives all the
        Autoconf-based configure scripts a hint about where the preferred
        version of Perl lives. If using
        <code class="filename">/usr/freeware/bin/perl</code> to run
        <span><strong class="command">configure.pl</strong></span>, we recommend that the
        <span><strong class="command">configure.pl</strong></span> command line appear similar to the
        following:</p><pre class="screen">/usr/freeware/bin/perl configure.pl --with-perl=/usr/freeware/bin</pre><p>Note that the value given to <code class="option">--with-perl</code> is the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>directory</em></span> where the <span><strong class="command">perl</strong></span>
        executable can be found. The configure scripts will add this directory
        to the front of the search path when trying to find a suitable
        <span><strong class="command">perl</strong></span> executable. Once it is found, all the Perl
        scripts used for configuration, compilation, and installation will use
        that executable.</p><p>To simplify command execution somewhat, it can help to have
        <code class="filename">/usr/freeware/bin</code> (or whatever path is
        appropriate) in your path before <code class="filename">/bin</code> or
        <code class="filename">/usr/bin</code> or any of the other myriad directories
        where Perl might exist on IRIX. In such a situation, none of the above
        extra steps should be necessary. The correct version of Perl will be
        found simply by virtue of it being early in your path.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e100"></a>MIPSpro Compiler Version</h4></div></div></div><p>Reports have been made on the VR Juggler mailing list regarding

        upgrading to Version 7.3.1.3m (or newer) fixes the problems.</p><p>A new feature of VR Juggler 1.1 is support for GCC on IRIX.
        Users who do not have MIPSpro or cannot upgrade can compile and run VR

      the issues concerning noncompliance to the C++ Standard with Visual
      Studio 6.0, and it appears that they have no plans to fix these
      problems. Therefore, we require the use of Visual Studio 7.x (.NET 2002
      or 2003) to compile the source code.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="source.code.section"></a>Getting the Source Code and the Dependencies</h2></div></div></div><p>In this section, we explain how to get the Juggler Project source
    code and the dependencies required to build Juggler. There are two ways to
    get the source code: from a pre-packaged source release archive or from
    the CVS repository on SourceForge. If you got the code from a pre-packaged
    source archive, that code is a complete &#8220;<span class="quote">snapshot</span>&#8221; of the CVS
    repository at the time of release. It contains all dependencies that would
    otherwise have been acquired using CVS. It <span class="emphasis"><em>does not</em></span>
    contain binary dependencies that must be downloaded separately (such as
    NSPR, the Java Developer Kit, a C++ compiler, etc.).</p><p>The current list of <span class="emphasis"><em>required</em></span> software packages
    is as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>CppDOM (<a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/xml-cppdom/" target="_top">http://www.sf.net/projects/xml-cppdom/</a>):
        A lightweight, easy-to-use XML parser written in C++. CppDOM must be
        compiled and installed for use with VR Juggler.</p></li><li><p>Boost (<a href="http://www.boost.org/" target="_top">http://www.boost.org/</a>): A C++
        library providing many powerful utility classes and libraries. Boost
        must be compiled and installed for use with VR Juggler.</p></li><li><p>GMTL (<a href="http://ggt.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">http://ggt.sf.net/</a>): A
        generic math library that makes use of C++ templates and STL
        paradigms. GMTL must be installed for use with VR Juggler.</p></li></ul></div><p>The following lists <span class="emphasis"><em>semi-optional</em></span>
    packages:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>NSPR (<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/nspr/" target="_top">http://www.mozilla.org/projects/nspr/</a>):
        The Netscape Portable Runtime, which can be used by VPR for threading
        and sockets (required on Win32 and Solaris).</p></li><li><p>Java Developer Kit (<a href="http://java.sun.com/" target="_top">http://java.sun.com/</a>): The J2SE SDK
        (or JDK) is used to compile all the Java code used in the Juggler
        Project. Without it, none of the Java code can be built. We require
        version 1.4 or newer. The Java Standard Edition (J2SE) can be
        downloaded from <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/" target="_top">http://java.sun.com/j2se/</a>.</p></li><li><p>omniORB (<a href="http://www.jdom.org/" target="_top">http://omniorb.sourceforge.net/</a>): A

        API.</p></li></ul></div><p>The third-party dependencies must be downloaded from the sites
    listed above and installed manually. You may also have to compile one or
    more of the packages if binary distributions are not available. Which
    packages you download depends on what you already have installed. Note
    carefully which packages are needed based on the software you have
    installed and what versions of tools (such as the JDK) that you
    download.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e188"></a>How to Get the Juggler Suite from CVS</h3></div></div></div><p>You can optionally get the Juggler Project as a source code

        If a binary version is not available for your operating system you
        must compile and install CppDOM yourself. Note that you need SCons
        (<a href="http://scons.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">http://scons.sourceforge.net/</a>)
        to build and install CppDOM.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e231"></a>GMTL</h4></div></div></div><p>For high-level mathematical operations, we use GMTL 0.3.2 or

        operating system primitives. On some platforms (IRIX, FreeBSD, Linux,
        Mac OS X), the use of NSPR is strictly optional. On others (Win32,
        HP-UX, and Solaris), it is required. Based on your local system, you
        should decide whether you need NSPR. Binary versions of NSPR can be
        downloaded from <a href="ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/nspr/releases" target="_top">ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/nspr/releases</a>.
        At this time, we recommend the use of version 4.2 or newer.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e250"></a>Java Developer Kit (also called the J2SE SDK)</h4></div></div></div><p>We make use of the Java programming language in addition to C++.
        Java is used exclusively for GUIs such as Tweek and VRJConfig (which
        is a JavaBean that is loaded into Tweek). To compile the Java code, a
        JDK is necessary. We currently require version 1.4 or newer. The Java
        Standard Edition can be downloaded from <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/" target="_top">http://java.sun.com/j2se/</a>.

It is required in
        order to compile the Tweek C++ API. At this time, the Tweek C++ API is
        not required for VR Juggler, but this situation will change in the
        near future. At this time, we primarily use omniORB 4.0.x. omniORB can
        be downloaded from <a href="http://omniorb.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">http://omniorb.sourceforge.net/</a>.</p><p>omniORB 3.0 has strange conventions for how installations are
        made. Within the <code class="filename">bin</code> and <code class="filename">lib</code>
        directories, there are platform-specific subdirectories that contain
        the actual binaries (except when installed on FreeBSD via the Ports
        Collection). Because of this, several extra options must be specified
        in order to tell the Tweek configure script where to find everything.

      may not be stable, and it may not even compile. Compiling VR Juggler
      itself can be a little complicated for anyone who does not have some
      background in using CVS, Autoconf, C++, and <span><strong class="command">make</strong></span> or
      Visual Studio.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e295"></a>Compiling the Juggler Suite of Tools</h3></div></div></div><p>This section explains how to get, configure, and compile all of
      the tools that make up VR Juggler. Each tool compiles to its own library
      and can be installed individually. (Refer to the
      <code class="filename">README</code> file in this directory for more information
      about the specific modules.)</p><p>To build VR Juggler on Windows, you must use the Visual Studio
      solution. After getting the dependencies needed to compile VR Juggler
      (see the next section), refer to the <a href="vc7/README.html" target="_top">README.html</a> file located in the
      <code class="filename">vc7</code> subdirectory of this directory. Do not bother
      to the rest of this document.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="config.vrjuggler.section"></a>Configuring the Juggler Build</h4></div></div></div><p>We now explain the process by which the Juggler build is
        configured. The Juggler Suite makes use of the well-known, widely used
        GNU tools Autoconf and GNU Make. We provide a wrapper script written
        in Perl called <span><strong class="command">configure.pl</strong></span> that gets the process
        started.</p><p>The Juggler build is highly automated. The trickiest part is
        telling the build where to find the third-party dependencies. This
        part can be simplified, however, by installing the third-party
        dependencies in the default location where the search will be
        performed. In most cases, this is <code class="filename">/usr/local</code>, but
        in others it is <code class="filename">/usr</code>. The default search location
        is determined by whether the dependency is considered to be a
        fundamental part of the operating system installation (such as OpenGL)
        or if it is an &#8220;<span class="quote">add-on</span>&#8221; package (such as Boost, GMTL,
        CppDOM, or omniORB).</p><div class="sidebar"><p>The distinction between <code class="filename">/usr/local</code> and
          <code class="filename">/usr</code> is complicated by the fact that most Linux
          distributions have <span class="emphasis"><em>everything</em></span> installed in
          <code class="filename">/usr</code>. While Linux may be popular, it should not
          (yet) be considered a model example of how to do things. In
          traditional UN*X distributions (BSD and System V),
          <code class="filename">/usr</code> is only used for the fundamental operating
          system pieces; <code class="filename">/usr/local</code> is used for extra
          bits. The Juggler build is based on these assumptions. Furthermore,
          most open source software packages (e.g., Boost, omniORB, Perl,
          Python) default to installing themselves in
          <code class="filename">/usr/local</code>, which suggests that the authors of
          those tools generally expect their software to be in
          <code class="filename">/usr/local</code>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="using.configure.pl"></a>Using <span><strong class="command">configure.pl</strong></span></h5></div></div></div><p>In the base <code class="filename">juggler</code> source directory, we

          Juggler and all of its dependencies. This includes Sonix, which is
          an interesting special case. Sonix can make use of Aaudiere, OpenAL,
          or AudioWorks to add sound to VR Juggler applications. If none of
          those packages is found, Sonix will &#8220;<span class="quote">stub out</span>&#8221; its
          sound APIs. This means that Sonix and the VR Juggler Sound Manager
          can still be used in applications, but no audio will be heard at run
          time. See <a href="#sonix.compile.section" title="Sonix">the section called &#8220;Sonix&#8221;</a> for more
