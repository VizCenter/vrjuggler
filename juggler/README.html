Within this document, you will find information about the new VR Juggler 2.0 directory structure including descriptions of all the component modules that make up the Juggler Project. Instructions for building the individual modules can be found within the specific module directories and on the VR Juggler website.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e22"></a>Compiling</h2></div></div><p>For information on compiling the source code, refer to the <tt>INSTALL</tt> file found in this directory.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="modules-section"></a>Modules</h2></div></div><p>The Juggler Project is made up of several modules that have evolved from the original VR Juggler source tree. Within this section, we describe each of the modules, what they are used for, and, when possible, how they relate to VR Juggler 1.0.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e35"></a>VR Juggler</h3></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e38"></a>Directory</h4></div></div><p><tt>juggler/modules/vrjuggler</tt></p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e44"></a>Description</h4></div></div><p>VR Juggler is still VR Juggler. There are many new features in VR Juggler since the 1.0 series, but in essence, it is still the same familiar tool. Of the projects listed below, VR Juggler depends on VPR, JCCL, and Gadgeteer. Its individual components have simply been broken out into individually developed modules. More information about the latest version of VR Juggler is given in the following section.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e49"></a>VR Juggler Portable Runtime (VPR)</h3></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e52"></a>Directory</h4></div></div><p><tt>juggler/modules/vapor</tt></p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e58"></a>Description</h4></div></div><p>VPR is the foundation for all the Juggler modules. It provides an object-oriented, cross-platform abstraction layer to common operating system features such as threads, semaphores, and sockets. All the other modules depend on VPR so that they may be ported easily to other platforms. In VR Juggler 1.0, VPR was the collection of directories Threads, SharedMem, and Sync. Since then, that code collected into a single library and greatly extended into what is now VPR.</p><p>VPR itself contains a great deal of platform-specific code. It categorizes this code into subsystems, and various subsystems may be chosen depending upon the target platform and target threading system. For example, on IRIX, there are three possible subsystems: SPROC, POSIX and Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR). Win32, on the other hand, only uses the NSPR subsystem. The subsystems are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>SPROC (IRIX only)</p></li><li><p>POSIX (UNIX-based platforms only)</p></li><li><p>NSPR (all platforms, required on Win32 and Mac OS X)</p></li></ul></div><p>Because VPR is the foundation for all the other modules, it is important to choose the right subsystem.</p><p>Choosing the correct subsystem depends on many factors. For example, which of the subsystems are supported on the desired target platform? Are there compatibility issues with software outside the Juggler Project? In most cases, however, the choice is straightforward. Indeed, IRIX is the only platform that presents any real issues. In particular, the use of OpenGL Performer from SGI raises important compatibility concerns. SPROC threads are the only threads that are stable with OpenGL Performer (on IRIX). POSIX threads will work, but applications may sometimes crash on startup. As of this writing, OpenGL Performer does not work at all with NSPR. Other software may pose similar problems, and it is important to know the needs of other tools when configuring VPR.</p><p>On platforms other than IRIX, the choice is relatively simple. If NSPR is available, its use is recommended. If NSPR is not available, POSIX threads is the next logical choice--at least on UNIX-based platforms. On Win32 and Mac OS X, NSPR is required.</p><p>As mentioned above, all the other modules depend on VPR, so it must be compiled before anything else. For more information on compiling VPR, refer to modules/vapor/INSTALL.txt.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e83"></a>Juggler Configuration and Control Library (JCCL)</h3></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e86"></a>Directory</h4></div></div><p><tt>juggler/modules/jackal</tt></p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e92"></a>Description</h4></div></div><p>JCCL provides the configuration layer for VR Juggler and other modules. The config chunks and reusable configuration editor JavaBeans come from JCCL. These JavaBeans are used by the VR Juggler configuration editor tool, VRJConfig. In essence, JCCL is the VR Juggler 1.0 Config directory with many new features including XML-based config files.</p><p>To build the JCCL C++ library, CppDOM is required for parsing XML. CppDOM is a lightweight XML parser written in C++ and designed to provide an interface similar to JDOM. More information can be found at <a href="http://xml-cppdom.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">http://xml-cppdom.sourceforge.net/</a>.</p><p>To build the configuration editor JavaBeans, JDOM and the Tweek Java API are required. JDOM can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.jdom.org/" target="_top">http://www.jdom.org/</a>. We require version B7 or newer, and we recommend version B8. Tweek is another module in the Juggler Project, and it will be built automatically as a dependency of JCCL.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e107"></a>Gadgeteer</h3></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e110"></a>Directory</h4></div></div><p><tt>juggler/modules/gadgeteer</tt></p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e116"></a>Description</h4></div></div><p>Gadgeteer is made up of the code that was formerly in the VR Juggler 1.0 Input directory. It contains all the drivers used for VR Juggler input devices, and it contains the high-level Input Manager. The goal with Gadgeteer is to mold it into the first dynamically loadable component within the VR Juggler microkernel. At this time, it must still be compiled in, but we hope to generalize the concepts of VR Juggler Managers to the point that the kernel knows nothing about them until they are loaded at run time.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e121"></a>Sonix</h3></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e124"></a>Directory</h4></div></div><p><tt>juggler/modules/sonix</tt></p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e130"></a>Description</h4></div></div><p>Sonix provides an interface useful to many simple VR and entertainment applications to trigger and position sounds in 3D. This library provides simple audio sound objects on top of several audio APIs. The interface to Sonix is kept very simple in order to get people up and running with sound as fast as possible.</p><p>The interface to sonix is kept very simple in order to get people up and running with sound as fast as possible. Sonix is reconfigurable allowing audio APIs to be safely swapped out at runtime without the dependent systems noticing. Systems using this layer expect to be completely portable.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e137"></a>Tweek</h3></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e140"></a>Directory</h4></div></div><p><tt>juggler/modules/tweek</tt></p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e146"></a>Description</h4></div></div><p>Tweek is a cross-platform, cross-language library consisting of a C++ API and a Java API. Its purpose is to provide a convenient mechanism for a Java-based GUI to interact with a complex C++ library or application. The Tweek GUI can be run in virtual environments, external on a palm top, or on the desktop next to a running application. Each of these methods gives a familiar 2D widget set that can control applications flexibly. To provide this capability, it uses CORBA.</p><p>The Java code in Tweek includes the Tweek Java API and the Tweek JavaBean loader application. The Java API is provided to make the use of JavaBeans and CORBA simpler for programmers. The JavaBean loader application simply loads the Beans it finds and presents them to the user in some sort of structured manner (for example, a collection of icons with web-style navigation).</p></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e153"></a>VR Juggler 2.0</h2></div></div><p>TODO...
