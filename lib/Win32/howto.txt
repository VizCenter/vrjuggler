How to get up and running with Visual C++ 6.0
Note:  You will need to set up all your test projects in the same way

1.  Create a new project
	a.  File..New
	b.  From the project tab choose Win32 Static Library
	c.  Enter a project name (ie Juggler)

2.  Update the project settings
	a.  Project..Settings (from the main menubar)
	b.  Choose the project name on the left side if its not already selected
	c.  Choose the C/C++ tab on the right side of the Project Settings Dialog
	d.  Add the following to the Project Options editbox:
	(Note you will need to reset these options if you switch from a
	debug build to a release build.  The debug build is the default)
		I.   /TP             (Compile all files as C++ regardless of extension)
		II.  /GR	     (Enable C++ RTTI)
		II.  /I.             (Add the Project directory to the include path)
		III. /MT  (or /MTd for debug)   (Enable multithreading, needed to compile vjThreadWin32)
		IV.  /I"C:\juggler"  (Add the Juggler root directory to the include path)
			(or the relative path to the juggler root, such as /I "..\..\")

3.  Add files to the project
	a.  Switch to fileview in the workspace toolbar
	b.  Right click on the project name, new folder
	c.  Create the new folder (ie "Config")
	d.  Add the relevant files to the new folder for the build

5.  Set up precompiled headers
	a.  add config.cpp to the project
	b.  Select Project..Settings..
		In the left pane select the config.cpp that you just added
		in the right pane:
		Select the c++ tab
		select Category precompiled headers
		select "Create precompiled header file (.pch)" radio button
			Through header:  config.h
	c.  All files add to the build will need #include <config.h> as the first header included for precompiled headers to work

---
To create an application that uses the library
	#include the headers necessary, update the project settings the same as for the static library
	Add a file to project, Juggler.lib from the build directory
	Add /FORCE:MULTIPLE    to the link options for applications to override the duplicate symbols error when linking
