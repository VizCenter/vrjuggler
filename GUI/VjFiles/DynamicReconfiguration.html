One of VR Juggler's most interesting and unique features is <i>dynamic
reconfiguration</i> - the ability to view and modify the configuration
of the VR Juggler system without restarting an application.
<p>
In addition to its role as a configuration file editor, VjControl is
also the user interface for viewing and changing VR Juggler's 
configuration.

<h2>Connecting to a VR Juggler application</h2>

VjControl communicates with VR Juggler applications over a TCP/IP
network connection.  This allows VjControl to control Juggler apps
remotely - from another computer, another room, or another city.
This feature is particularly valuable because many VR systems
take over their host computer's display, limiting the use of 
traditional GUI programs.

<p>
To connect to a VR Juggler application, switch to the "Connections"
panel in VjControl.  You will need to enter the hostname and port
number that the Juggler app is listening to.  The hostname and
port are in turn specified by one of the configuration files given
to the application at startup time (in an 
<a href="DescHelp/EnvironmentManager.html">Environment Manager</a>
ConfigChunk) and are printed to the console as part of the application's
initialization.
<p>
Once the hostname and port number are in place, press the "Connect"
button, and VjControl will open a communications channel to the
Juggler app.
<p>
Alternately, you can specify the hostname and port with VjControl's
<a href="cmdline.html">command-line arguments</a> and it will
connect automatically.

<h2>Viewing and changing the Active Configuration</h2>

Once the connection has been established, switch to the "Configure"
panel in VjControl.  The list of loaded configuration files which
can be selected will contain a new entry called "Active 
Configuration".  Selecting this will display the current
configuration of the Juggler application - all of the active
components displayed as if they were just another configuration
file.
<p>
Unlike a simple configuration file, changes to this database do
not just change VjControl's internal representation.  If the 
user removes a ConfigChunk from the Active Configuration, or
copies a Chunk into it, or edits a Chunk and presses the "OK"
or "Apply" button, VjControl will send a reconfiguration
command across the network connection to the VR Juggler 
application.  The app will process the reconfiguration command
and send an updated snapshot of its configuration to VjControl.
<p>
Adding a new ConfigChunk to the Active Configuration (as opposed
to copying a Chunk into it) does not send a reconfiguration
command to the application, since assumably the new Chunk still
needs to be edited by the user.  The new Chunk won't be sent to
the VR Juggler app until the user edits it and presses the "OK"
or "Apply" button in the ConfigChunk editor window.
