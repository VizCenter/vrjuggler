Welcome to VR Juggler VjControl!  This section will tell you how to set up
and run the VjControl program.  It assumes that VR Juggler
has already been installed on your system.

<h2>System Requirements</h2>
<p>
VjControl is a Java application designed to take full advantage of Sun's
Java Foundation Classes (the "Swing" classes).  The current version requires
at least JDK1.2, though JDK1.3 is recommended.

<p>
<h2>Setup</h2>

Before trying to run VjControl, you should perform the steps discussed
under "User Setup" in the
<i>VR Juggler Getting Started Guide</i>.  In particular, make sure all 
your environment variables are set correctly.

<p>
It is important that you create a <TT>~/.vjconfig</TT> directory, as this
is where vjcontrol stores its own preferences.

<p>
You should also find out where the Juggler config files you should use 
are located.
The Juggler distribution includes a number of sample config files
in the directory <TT>$VJ_BASE_DIR/share/Data/configFiles</TT>.  Your system
administrators may also have a location for customized config files.
For ease of use, you may wish to copy commonly-used config files to your
<TT>~/.vjconfig</TT> directory.  This is also a good place to keep any
config files that you modify to your own tastes.

<h2>Starting VjControl</h2>

On Unix/Linux systems, type:
<pre>
        vjcontrol
</pre>

Windows users should use the script:
<pre>
        vjcontrol.bat
</pre>

(if you did not add <tt>$VJ_BASE_DIR/bin</tt> to your search path, you'll
need to give the entire path to VjControl on the command line).

<p>
VjControl's <a href="Preferences.html">Preferences</a> control what files
are loaded automatically on startup.  There are also <a href="cmdline.html">
command-line arguments</a> that can be used to load files at startup.  With
the default preferences, vjcontrol will attempt to load 
<TT>$VJ_BASE_DIR/share/Data/chunksDesc</TT>, which contains definitions for the
basic types of VR Juggler configuration information.

<h2>The Main Window</h2>

The main Juggler window consists of a set of panels accessed by a row of tabs:
<br>
<img src="./gfx/MainWindowTabs.png" alt="Window Tabs Picture" width="456" height="27">
<br>

Clicking on a tab exposes its panel; each panel gives access to a particular
Juggler function:

<dl>
<dt><a href="ChunkDBPanel.html">Configure</a>
<dd>Panel for editing and viewing Juggler config files.  This is the most
important option for new users.
<dt><a href="DynamicReconfiguration.html">Connection</a>
<dd>Panel for connecting to Juggler applications.  Used for dynamic reconfiguration.
<dt><a href="DescDBPanel.html">Descriptions</a>
<dd>Panel used for editing and viewing Juggler Chunk Description files.
<dt><a href="OrgTreePanel.html">Org Tree</a>
<dd>Panel used for editing the Chunk Organization Tree, which controls how
the chunks in a file are organized in the Configure panel.
<dt>Messages
<dd>Panel used for logging error and informational messages from vjcontrol.
<dt><a href="PerformancePanel.html">Performance</a>
<dd>Panel used for viewing Juggler performance data files.
</dl>

<p>
In addition to these tabbed panels, the vjcontrol main window also 
has a fairly typical set of File, Help, and <a href="Preferences.html">
Options</a> menus.

<h2>Loading Files</h2>

VR Juggler uses two types of files: <i>Config Files</i> and <i>ChunkDesc Files</i>.

<ul>
<li><i>Config Files</i> are made of 'Chunks' of information.  For example,
one chunk will describe the setup of a display device while another will
describe the setup for a keyboard or tracking system.  There will typically
be several readymade config files in the <tt>$VJ_BASE_DIR/share/Data</tt> directory,
with names like <tt>simulator.config</tt> or <tt>C2_4wall.config</tt>.

<li><i>ChunkDesc Files</i> define the different kinds of chunks (ie. what kind
of information a Keyboard chunk should have, or a Display chunk).  The main
ChunkDesc file for VR Juggler is usually <tt>$VJ_BASE_DIR/share/Data/chunksDesc</tt>.
</ul>

To load a Config or ChunkDesc file, click on the "Configure" or "Descriptions"
tabs of the VjControl GUI, and then press the "Load" button.
