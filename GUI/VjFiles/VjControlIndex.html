This section describes how to use vjcontrol, the VR Juggler configuration and
control program.  If you haven't already, you may want to read the
``ConfigChunk Primer'' in the Juggler documentation.  ConfigChunks
are the main unit of VR Juggler configuration Information.

<p>
You'll probably also be interested in ``Configuring VR Juggler Applications'',
 which goes into the details of
what all the stuff in a Juggler config file is used for, and gives information
about configuring displays, input devices, and so forth.
