Working with ChunkOrgTrees</H2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
ChunkOrgTrees are used to provide the tree layout of config file contents
used in the "Configure" pane.  By clicking on the "Org Tree" tab, you can
examine and modify this layout.

<p>
The bulk of the OrgTree pane is taken up by a view of the tree currently in 
use.  The folders represent different categories of config data - "input",
"displays", etc.  The leaves, or documents, of the tree are labeled with 
the names of types of ConfigChunks.  When viewing a config file in the 
"Configure" pane, the same tree structure will be used, but the leaves will
be replaced with folders containing all the chunks in the file of a given
type.

<p>
One additional note: a folder in the OrgTree with the name "*" will 
include all ConfigChunks in a config file, of any type.  It's useful
to include a folder named "*" in any tree, in case you've forgotten
to include a chunk type in your structure.  This way, you'll still be 
guaranteed to be able to see the entire file contents.

<p>
The New, Save, and Load buttons work in the same way as the other panels, but
there are also a number of additional features:

<ul>
<li>The <b>Apply</b> button is used to update the config file views in the
Configure pane to use the tree shown in the OrgTree pane.  Use this button
after loading an OrgTree file or making changes to the structure.

<li>You can select elements in the tree by clicking on them.  The <b>Remove</b>
button deletes all selected elements from the tree.<html>

<li>You can change the name of a tree element by double-clicking on it.

<li>Right-clicking on a tree element brings up a context menu.  This
menu lets you insert folders or Chunk types, or remove the element.

</ul>

<h3>Missing Functionality</h3>
The major missing feature in the current OrgTree is the ability to drag
around elements of the tree to rearrange them.  This ability is forthcoming.
For the time being, curious and adventurous readers are referred to the
