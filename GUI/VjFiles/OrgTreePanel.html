Working with ConfigChunk organization trees</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
Vjcontrol uses Chunk Organization Trees (OrgTrees) to put some order in
the display of config files.  The OrgTree defines the hierarchical tree
view used in the "Configure" pane.  To illustrate the point, here are two
snapshots of the same config file viewed with different OrgTrees:

<p>
<img alt="OrgTree Example 1" align=bottom src="./gfx/OrgTreeDemo1.jpg" width="309" height="416"></img>
<img alt="OrgTree Example 2" src="./gfx/OrgTreeDemo2.jpg" width="312" height="415"></img>
<p>

As you can see, the same ConfigChunks exist in each view - just the way
they're grouped together changes.

<p>Clicking on the "Org Tree" tab displays a panel which shows the OrgTree
currently in use and provides rudimentary editing capabilities.  Here's
a picture of the OrgTree panel showing the (rather silly) example used 
in the above right picture:

<p>

<p>
The bulk of the OrgTree pane is taken up by a view of the tree currently in 
use.  The folders represent different categories of config data - "Input",
"Displays", "My Favorite Chunks", etc.  The leaves of the tree are labeled with 
the names of types of ConfigChunks.  When viewing a config file in the 
"Configure" pane, the same tree structure will be used, but the leaves will
be replaced with folders containing all the chunks in the file of a given
type.

<p>
One additional note: a folder in the OrgTree with the name "*" will 
include all ConfigChunks in a config file.  It's useful
to include a folder named "*" in any OrgTree, so that you're sure to see all 
the chunks in any config file.

<p>
The New, Save, and Load buttons work in the same way as the other panels, but
there are also a number of additional features:

<ul>
<li>The <b>Apply</b> button is used to update the views in the
Configure pane to use the tree shown in the OrgTree pane.  Use this button
after loading an OrgTree file or making changes to the structure.

<li>You can select elements in the tree by clicking on them.  The <b>Remove</b>
button deletes all selected elements from the tree.<html>

<li>You can change the name of a tree element by double-clicking on it.

<li>Right-clicking on a tree element brings up a menu:
<p><img align=bottom src="./gfx/OrgTreePanel2.png"></img>  
<p>
This
menu lets you insert folders or Chunk types, or remove the element.

</ul>

<h2>Missing Functionality</h2>
The major missing feature in the current OrgTree is the ability to drag
around elements of the tree to rearrange them.  This ability is forthcoming.
