<h1>Configuring VR Juggler Applications</h1>

<p>
VR Juggler applications are configured by using ConfigChunks.  These Chunks
can be specified in a configuration file which the application reads at
startup, or they can be added to a running application using the VjControl
tool.
</p>

<p>
This page documents particular kinds of ConfigChunks, and how they
can be used with Juggler applications.  This includes adding 
and configuring input devices, controlling displays, and setting up the VR
  Juggler simulator mode. 
</p>

<p>
The Chunks in the listing below have been divided into general categories.
Each Chunk name is a hyperlink to a detailed description.
</p>

<p>
For many chunks,
it is reasonable and useful to have multiple instances in
your configuration (displays are an obvious example).  Others are 
"singletons" - they provide some sort of global information, and it
wouldn't make sense to have multiple definitions.  Singleton Chunks
are noted in the descriptions.  If a Juggler configuration does contain
multiple instances of a singleton Chunk - multiple EnvironmentManager Chunks,
for example - the most recently read Chunk will supercede older ConfigChunks.

<h2><a name="meta">"Meta" Chunks</a></h2>

<p>
VR Juggler defines two ConfigChunks which don't correspond to components 
of the VR system itself, but rather impact how configuration files are
loaded in the first place.

<dl>

<dt><a href="DescHelp/vjIncludeFile.html">Config File Include</a>
<dd>The Config File Include chunk gives the name
of an additional config file which should be loaded whenever this chunk
is encountered.

<dt><a href="DescHelp/vjIncludeDescFile.html">ChunkDesc File Include</a>
<dd>The ChunkDesc File Include chunk gives the name
of an additional chunk descriptions file which should be loaded whenever 
this chunk is encountered.  ChunkDesc Include Chunks are particularly
useful in configuration files that include application-defined ConfigChunk
types.

</dl>


<h2><a name="display">Display Chunks</a></h2>

<p>
VR Juggler gives you a great deal of latitude in defining displays. 
For example, you can use a combination of surface displays and 
simulator displays, or maybe just one or
  more simulator displays. Each display window is configured by a 
Simulator or Surface Display ConfigChunk. To add a new display window, 
simply add a new Display ConfigChunk to your
 configuration file and edit it to taste. 

<dl>
<dt><a href="DescHelp/simDisplay.html">Simulator Display</a>
<dd>Opens a display window suitable for simulator-style use.  The
simulator window uses a "camera" attached to an arbitrary position
input, and can graphically show the position of a user's head,
wands, gloves, surface displays, and projection frustums.

<dt><a href="DescHelp/surfaceDisplay.html">Surface Display</a>
<dd>Opens a display window suitable for use with a projection screen.
The dimensions and position of the surface can be freely defined in 3d space.

<dt><a href="DescHelp/displaySystem.html">Display System</a>
<dd>This chunk (a singleton) tells VR Juggler about the number of
video channels on a machine, and how they map to X Window displays.


</dl>

<h2><a name="input">Input</a></h2>

Any input devices that are defined in your config file will be initialized 
at application startup. So, to add a new device, all you have to do is add 
a ConfigChunk which describes its configuration. This section describes 
the ConfigChunks for the input devices supported by VR Juggler.


<ul>

<h3><li>Input Manager</h3>
<dl>
<dt><a href="DescHelp/InputManager.html">Input Manager</a>
<dd>This singleton chunk specifies some useful default values
for the input devices, such as a default position and orientation
of positional devices.
</dl>

<p><h3><li>Input Devices</h3>
</p>

<dl>
<dt><a href="DescHelp/Flock.html">Flock of Birds</a>
<dd>Configuration for Ascension Flock of Birds tracking system.

<dt><a href="DescHelp/MotionStar.html">MotionStar</a>
<dd>Configuration for Ascension MotionStar wireless tracking system.

<dt>Trackd Controller (experimental)
<dd>Configuation for a Trackd controller memory area.

<dt>Trackd Sensor (experimental)
<dd>Configuration for a Trackd sensor memory area.

<dt><a href="DescHelp/Isense.html">Intersense tracker</a>
<dd>Configuration for Intersense trackers.

<dt><a href="DescHelp/IBox.html">IBox</a>
<dd>Configuration for Immersion Corp. IBox.

<dt><a href="DescHelp/CyberGlove.html">CyberGlove</a>
<dd>Configuration for a Virtual Technologies CyberGlove.  The glove is a gesture device,
and can also have a positional device attached to it.

<dt><a href="DescHelp/ThreeDMouse.html">3D Mouse</a>
<dd>Configuration for Logitech 3D Mouse.

<dt><a href="DescHelp/Keyboard.html">Keyboard Input Window</a>
<dd>This device opens a window on a display which accepts keypresses
and mouse movement information.  It is usually used to provide input
for the simulated devices described below.

</dl>

<p><h3><li>Simulator Devices</h3>
</p>

<p>
VR Juggler provides a complete set of simulated input devices for use in
testing applications.  The simulated devices generally attach to a Keyboard
Input Window.  The mapping of keypresses to actions is completely configurable.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><a href="DescHelp/SimDigital.html">Digital Simulator</a>
<dd>Provides one or more digital inputs (on/off values).

<dt><a href="DescHelp/SimAnalog.html">Analog Simulator</a>
<dd>Provides one or more analog inputs (inputs in a continuous range).
Keypresses to move up and down for each device, and the increment for
a single keypress, can be configured.

<dt><a href="DescHelp/SimPosition.html">Position Simulator</a>
<dd>Simulates a single positional input (i.e. a tracker).  Users can configure
the keypresses to use for movement and rotation on each access, delta for
movement and rotation, and initial values.

<dt><a href="DescHelp/SimGloveGesture.html">Glove Gesture Simulator</a>
<dd>Simulates a gesture input device (i.e. a glove).

<dt><a href="DescHelp/simKeyboardDigital.html">simKeyboardDigital</a>
<dd>This is a rather unusual device.  It uses digital input devices
to simulate a keyboard - which can be used to drive other simulator
devices!

<dt><a href="DescHelp/DummyPosition.html">Dummy Position</a>
<dd>A fake positional device, which always returns a constant (configurable)
position and orientation.

</dl>

<h3><li>Proxies and Proxy Aliases</h3>

<p>
Proxies are the mechanism for making access to input devices generic.
A Configuration file should include a proxy for every possible input
source.  Each proxy is defined with the name of the device it accesses
and a unit number (for devices that provide multiple inputs).
</p>

<dl>

<dt><a href="DescHelp/DigProxy.html">Digital Proxy</a>
<dd>Proxy for digital devices.

<dt><a href="DescHelp/AnaProxy.html">Analog Proxy</a>
<dd>Proxy for analog devices.

<dt><a href="DescHelp/PosProxy.html">Position Proxy</a>
<dd>Proxy for position devices.  The Position Proxy also allows you to
apply a transformation to the position data returned from the device.

<dt><a href="DescHelp/GloveProxy.html">Glove Proxy</a>
<dd>Proxy for a glove device.

<dt><a href="DescHelp/GestureProxy.html">Gesture Proxy</a>
<dd>Proxy for a gesture device.

<dt><a href="DescHelp/KeyboardProxy.html">Keyboard Proxy</a>
<dd>Proxy for keyboard devices.

<dt><a href="DescHelp/proxyAlias.html">Proxy Alias</a>
<dd>Proxy aliases are used to create additional names to refer to
proxies.

</dl>

</ul>



<p><h2><a name="env">Environment Manager</a></h2>

<p>
The Environment Manager(EM) is the part of VR Juggler that controls communications
with the GUI program, vjcontrol.  It also controls Juggler's performance
monitoring capabilities.
<br>

<dl>

<dt><a href="DescHelp/EnvironmentManager.html">Environment Manager</a>
<dd>The Environment Manager chunk, a singleton, allows the user to 
configure the network setup of a Juggler app (whether to accept connections
or not, what network port to listen on, etc).

<dt><a href="DescHelp/PerfMeasure.html">Performance Measurements</a>
<dd>This chunk, also a singleton, allows you to turn Juggler's internal
performance measurements on and off.  

<dt><a href="DescHelp/FileConnect.html">EM Connection</a>
<dd>These chunks define data connections - files or sockets - that
the EM can connect to.  An EM Connection is created automatically
whenever a vjcontrol process connects to a Juggler application. Another
common use of EM Connections is to define an output file for Juggler
performance data.

</dl>


<p><h2><a name="misc">Miscellaneous</a></h2>
</p>

<dl>
<dt><a href="DescHelp/JugglerUser.html">Juggler User</a>
<dd>One of the eventual goals of VR Juggler is to provide full support
for multiple users.  The first step is the Juggler User chunk, which
currently associates a positional input proxy with a user's head.  You'll
need to create at least one of these, to use as a target of your Display
chunks.

<dt><a href="DescHelp/apiPerformer.html">Performer API</a>
<dd>This singleton Chunk defines a few properties needed for using Iris 
Performer-based
Juggler applications.  If you aren't using Performer, you don't need to
worry about this one.

</dl>

<h2><a name="vjcontrol">VjControl-specific chunks</a></h2>

<p>
The VR Juggler control program, vjcontrol, also uses some ConfigChunks
for its own configuration.  Generally, these will be kept in a separate
file (<TT>~/.vjconfig/vjcontrol.config</TT>).
</p>

<p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="DescHelp/vjcontrol.html">VjControl Configuration</a>
<dd>This chunk stores VjControl's preferences information.

<dt><a href="DescHelp/PerfData.html">Performance Data Display</a>
<dd>Chunks of this type give VjControl information on how to display
and interpret performance data gathered from a Juggler application
or a performance log file.

</dl>
