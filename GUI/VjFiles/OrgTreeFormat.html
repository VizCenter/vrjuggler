File format for VR Juggler Chunk Organization Tree files</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
A Chunk Organization Tree (OrgTree) is used to put a logical tree structure
onto a ConfigChunkDB.  VjControl uses the OrgTree to provide a 
file-folder-like view of a config file.

<p>
The OrgTree file is composed of OrgTreeElements, which look like this:

<pre>
begin "name"
      <i>contents</i>
end
</pre>

<p>
where <i>contents</i> is a list of OrgTreeElements and chunk type names, 
separated by whitespace (Note that that's chunk type <i>names</i>, not
tokens).  The entire file is a single OrgTreeElement (usually
called "root", though the GUI never actually uses its name) containing
all the other elements. Here's a real example:

<p>
<pre>
Begin "Zelda"
    Begin "Input"
        Begin "Proxies and Aliases"
            "ProxyAlias"
        End
        Begin "Input Devices"
            "Keyboard"
            "flock"
            "ibox"
            "Cyberglove"
            "ThreeDMouse"
            "DummyPosition"
        End
    End
    Begin "Expert Only"
        Begin "Performer API"
            "ApiPerformer"
        End
        Begin "Environment Manager"
            "Environment Manager"
            "EM File Output"
        End
    End
    Begin "*"
    End
End   
</pre>

<p>
This OrgTree will create a tree view where, for example, the top
level will have a subfolder called "Input" containing a folder called
"Input Devices" which will list all chunks of types Keyboard, flock,
ibox, etc.

<p>
There are two important things to note:  first, it's entirely ok for chunk
type names to appear in multiple folders.  Second, the last OrgTreeElement 
has the name "*" and no children.  Any OrgTreeElement named "*" will 
represent a folder that lists all available chunks of any type.
