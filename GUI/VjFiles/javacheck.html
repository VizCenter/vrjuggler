<title>Checking your Java version</title>

<h2><img src="juggler.gif" width="29" height="33"></img>Checking your Java version</h2>

To determine what version of Java is installed on your system, use the
command:

<pre>
        java -version
</pre>

Note that this assumes the java command is in your search path.  If not,
you will have to ask or find where it is installed in your system.  
Typical locations include <tt>/usr/local/java/bin/java</tt>,
<tt>/usr/java/bin/java</tt>, and <tt>/usr/bin/java</tt>.

<p>
Typically, the result printed out by the java executable will be something
like this:

<pre>
java version "1.3.0"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.3.0)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.3.0, mixed mode)
</pre>

The example above is taken from Sun's JDK1.3 for Linux.  As noted on the
<a href="GettingStarted.html">Getting Started</a> page, Java 1.2.0 or 
better is needed to run VjControl.
