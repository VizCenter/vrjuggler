<h2><img src="juggler.gif"></img>Working with Description Files</h2>

You can load and edit VR Juggler Chunk Description Files by clicking on the 
"Descriptions" tab of the main window.

<p>The Descriptions panel is similar to the <a href="ChunkDBPanel.html">
Configure panel</a>, though at this time it has only one display area.

<p>
At the top of the panel is a ComboBox that lets you choose which of the
loaded config files to display.  The selected file will appear in the
middle of the panel.  Click on a Description in the list
to select it.  You can double-click
on a Description to view or edit it.

<p>
There are six buttons along the side of each panel:

<ul>
<li>New - creates a new (empty) descriptions file.
<li>Load - loads a descriptions file and views it in this panel.
<li>Save - save the descriptions file currently being viewed.  Note that this
button always opens a file dialog, so it's technically Save As...
<li>Close - removes the currently viewed description file from memory.
<b>WARNING!</b> VjControl does not currently warn you if you close a
file without saving it.

<li>Remove - deletes all selected descriptions in the currently viewed file.
<li>Insert - inserts a new description.  Initially, a new description only
has one property - the instance name.

</ul>
