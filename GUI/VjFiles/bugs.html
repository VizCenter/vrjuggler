<h2><img src="juggler.gif"></img>VjControl 1.0 Known Bugs</h2>

<ul>
<li>VjControl is perfect.  It has no bugs.  If in doubt, repeat this as a 
mantra until you believe.

<br><li>File names of loaded chunkorgtrees are not stored correctly,
resulting in weird defaults for the org tree save file requester.

<br><li>Double-clicking on chunk names in the org tree panel can occasionally 
cause a null pointer exception.  This appears to be a bug in JFC mouse
click handling, and can safely be ignored.

<br><li>Changes made by editing description files (adding, removing, or editing
ChunkDescs) in the Description pane are ignored by the Configure pane.
If you modify a descriptions file in any significant way, you should save,
quit VjControl, and then restart to modify the chunks.

<br><li>Strings can't contain quotes (parsing bug).

<br><li>Various textfields will currently allow illegal input.
This should be fixed now.

<br><li>The help panel (ie the window you're looking at now) doesn't respond to
the font selected in preferences.

<br><li>Additional frames that are open when vjcontrol's look & feel are 
changed don't adopt the new look and feel. (The help panel never changes look & feel).

<br><li>Some menu items don't respond to font changes.
Should be fixed.

<br><li>No matter what you do, <b>DO NOT</b> click on the word <a href="http://www.public.iastate.edu/~pyre/area.html">crotch</a>.

</ul>
