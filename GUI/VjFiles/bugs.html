<h2><img src="juggler.gif"></img>VjControl 1.0 Known Bugs</h2>

<ul>
<li>VjControl is perfect.  It has no bugs.  If in doubt, repeat this as a 
mantra until you believe.

<br><li>If you remove the ConfigChunk that represents the connection
to the GUI, the GUI won't notice that the connection has been closed,
even though it has. (new improved non-fatal vjConnect suicide bug).
Using the ``Disconnect'' button is preferred.

<br><li>vjcontrol doesn't warn you if you modify a file and then close it
without saving.

<br><li>Changes made by editing description files (adding, removing, or editing
ChunkDescs) in the Description pane are ignored by the Configure pane.
If you modify a descriptions file in any significant way, you should save,
quit VjControl, and then restart to modify the chunks.

<br><li>Default chunk files are only loaded at vjcontrol startup.  If you edit
the chunk files or change the file names in preferences, these won't take effect
until you restart vjcontrol.

<br><li>Strings can't contain quotes (parsing bug).

<br><li>The help panel (ie the window you're looking at now) doesn't respond to
the font selected in preferences.

<br><li>Run-time performance monitoring with multiple graphing windows open
can be quite CPU-intensive (Java-too-slow error).

<br><li>The "Print" option in the Performance panel actually just writes a
summary to the standard output stream.

<br><li>The Performance Graph windows occasionally display garbage when
first opened.  Close & reopen to correct.

</ul>
<br>

<h2>Fixed in 1.0</h2>

<ul>
<br><li>backspace was ignored for certain widgets when run on Linux.

<br><li>Additional frames that are open when vjcontrol's look & feel are 
changed don't adopt the new look and feel. (The help panel never changes look & feel).
