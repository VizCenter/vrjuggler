<h2><img src="juggler.gif"></img>VjControl 1.0 Known Bugs</h2>

<ul>
<li>VjControl is perfect.  It has no bugs.  If in doubt, repeat this as a 
mantra until you believe.

<br><li>File names of loaded chunkorgtrees are not stored correctly,
resulting in weird defaults for the org tree save file requester.

<br><li>When dynamically reconfiguring a Juggler app, do not remove the 
EM Connect ConfigChunk representing the connection between vjcontrol and
the app.  This will cause the app to freeze (vjConnect suicide bug).
Instead, use the <TT>Disconnect</TT> button in the Connections panel.

<br><li>vjcontrol doesn't warn you if you modify a file and then close it
without saving.

<br><li>Changes made by editing description files (adding, removing, or editing
ChunkDescs) in the Description pane are ignored by the Configure pane.
If you modify a descriptions file in any significant way, you should save,
quit VjControl, and then restart to modify the chunks.

<br><li>Strings can't contain quotes (parsing bug).

<br><li>The current jdk1.2 release for Irix has some annoying minor glitches
with window placement & sizing.

<br><li>Double-clicking on chunk names in the org tree panel can occasionally 
cause a null pointer exception.  This appears to be a bug in JFC 1.1 mouse
click handling, and can safely be ignored.

<br><li>The help panel (ie the window you're looking at now) doesn't respond to
the font selected in preferences.

<br><li>Additional frames that are open when vjcontrol's look & feel are 
changed don't adopt the new look and feel. (The help panel never changes look & feel).

<br><li>Run-time performance monitoring with multiple graphing windows open
can be quite CPU-intensive (Java-too-slow error).

<br><li>The "Print" option in the Performance panel actually just writes a
summary to the standard output stream.

<br><li>The Performance Graph windows occasionally display garbage when
first opened.  Close & reopen to correct.

</ul>
