<h2><img src="juggler.gif"></img>Working with Config Files</h2>

You can load and edit VR Juggler Config Files by clicking on the 
"Configure" tab of the main window.  This displays a panel that
is divided into two similar parts.  The idea is that you can
view one file on each side, making it easy to compare two files
and to copy Chunks back and forth between them.

<p>
At the top of each panel is a ComboBox that lets you choose which of the
loaded config files to display.  The selected file will appear in a
tree format in the middle of the panel.  Click on a Chunk in the tree
to select it.  You can double-click
on a chunk to view or edit it.

<p>
There are eight buttons along the side of each panel:

<ul>
<li><b>New</b> - creates a new (empty) config file.
<li><b>Load</b> - loads a config file and views it in this panel.
<li><b>Save</b> - save the config file currently being viewed.  Note that this
button always opens a file dialog, so it's technically Save As...
<li><b>Close</b> - removes the currently viewed config file from memory.
<b>WARNING!</b> VjControl does not currently warn you if you close a
file without saving it.

<li><b>>></b> - copies all selected chunks in this file to the file
being viewed in the other panel.
<li><b>>All></b> - copies every chunk in this file to the file being
viewed in the other panel.
<li><b>Remove</b> - deletes all selected chunks in the currently viewed file.
<li><b>Duplicate</b> - adds duplicate copies of all selected chunks in the currently viewed file.
<li><b>Insert</b> - inserts a new chunk.  The type of chunk to insert is determined
by the Insert Type combo box at the bottom of the panel.

</ul>

<h3> The ConfigChunk Editing Window</h3>

Double-click on one of the ConfigChunks in the tree to open the
ConfigChunk editing window.  This window displays the values for all 
the Chunk's properties, and lets you modify these values.  Properties
that allow a variable number of values will include an <b>Add Value</b> button
next to the Property name, and a <b>Remove</b> button next to each value.
<p>
Click the <b>OK</b> button to exit the window, or <b>Cancel</b> to close
the window without saving the changes you've made.

<h3>Including other Config Files</h3>

VR Juggler config files can include references to other config files.  If a config file with
includes is loaded by a Juggler app, all the files it includes are loaded first (so a chunk
in the file can replace a chunk in an included file with the same name).
<p>
If a config file with includes is loaded into vjcontrol, the included files are automatically
loaded, though each file is viewed separately.
<p>
To include a file, simply add an "Include File" chunk to the config file.  The name of the 
"Include File" chunk is the complete path name of the file to load.  You can use the strings
"$HOME" and "$VJ_BASE_DIR" at the start of the name to refer to your home directory and the
Juggler install directory, respectively.
<p>
Note that path names should be absolute paths (paths starting with "/" or "$HOME" or "$VJ_BASE_DIR").
Relative path names should be relative to the file including them, but this may not work
correctly in Juggler Beta1
