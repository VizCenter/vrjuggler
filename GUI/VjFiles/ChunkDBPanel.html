<title>Working with Config Files</title>

<h1><img src="juggler.gif" width="29" height="33"></img>Working with configuration files</h1>

Clicking on vjcontrol's "Configure" tab lets you view and edit VR
Juggler config files.  The display consists of two similar
panels, side by side.  The idea is that you can
view one file on each side, making it easy to compare two files
and to copy Chunks back and forth between them.

<p>

<p>
At the top of each panel is a ComboBox that lets you choose which of the
loaded config files to display.  The selected file will appear in a
tree format in the middle of the panel.

<p>
Chunks in the display are organized by type and by broader categories.
The specific organization of the tree is determined by vjcontrol's current
ChunkOrgTree.  See "<a href="OrgTreePanel.html">Editing the Chunk Organization
Tree</a>" for more information.

<p>
You can click on a Chunk in the tree
to select it.  Double-clicking on a Chunk brings up a window that
lets you view or edit the Chunk.  Right-clicking on a Chunk brings 
up a small menu that lets you view help information on that 
Chunk (if available) or remove it from the file:

<p>
  Also, right-clicking
on folders that represent Chunk types brings up a small menu letting
you insert new Chunks.

<p>
There are eight buttons along the side of each panel:

<ul>
<li><b>New</b> - creates a new (empty) config file.
<li><b>Load</b> - loads a config file and views it in this panel.
<li><b>Save</b> - save the config file currently being viewed.  Note that this
button always opens a file dialog, so it's technically Save As...
<li><b>Close</b> - removes the currently viewed config file from memory.
<b>WARNING!</b> VjControl does not currently warn you if you close a
file without saving it.

<li><b>>></b> - copies all selected chunks in this file to the file
being viewed in the other panel.
<li><b>>All></b> - copies every chunk in this file to the file being
viewed in the other panel.
<li><b>Remove</b> - deletes all selected chunks in the currently viewed file.
<li><b>Duplicate</b> - adds duplicate copies of all selected chunks in the currently viewed file.
<li><b>Insert</b> - inserts a new chunk.  The type of chunk to insert is determined
by the Insert Type combo box at the bottom of the panel.

</ul>

<h2> The ConfigChunk editing window</h2>

Double-click on one of the ConfigChunks in the tree to open the
ConfigChunk editing window.  This window displays the values for all 
the Chunk's properties, and lets you modify these values.

<p>

<p>

Some properties in a Chunk allow a variable number of values.  These 
include an <tt>Add Value</tt> button next to the property name,
and a <tt>Remove</tt> button next to each value:

<p>
<p>
Click the <TT>OK</TT> button to exit the window, or <TT>Cancel</TT> to close
the window without saving the changes you've made.

<h2>Including other configuration files</h2>

VR Juggler includes the idea of an "Include File" chunk, which has
one property: the pathname of a Juggler config file.  When 
a Juggler app loads a file with an "Include File" chunk, it will also
load the file named in that chunk.  This means that it is possible
to make a config file that's just a list of other config files to
be loaded.

<p>
Similarly, there are "Include Description File" chunks which will cause
Juggler to automatically load a ChunkDesc file.  This is particularly 
useful for config files which contain application-specific kinds of
ConfigChunks.

<p>
If a config file with includes is loaded into vjcontrol, the included 
files are automatically loaded, though each file is viewed separately.

<p>
To include a file, simply add an "Include File" (or "Include Descriptions 
File") chunk to the config file.  The name of the "Include File" chunk is 
the path name of the file to load.  You can use the strings
"<TT>$HOME</TT>" and "<TT>$VJ_BASE_DIR</TT>" at the start of the name to 
refer to your home directory and the Juggler install directory, 
respectively.

<p>
Relative path names in includes (e.g. paths that don't start with "/" or 
"C:" etc.) are relative to the location of the file containing the "Include
File" chunk.  For example,
if the config file "/home/vr/vjconfig/c2.config" includes the file
"C2/displays.config", Juggler will try to load a file named
"/home/vr/vjconfig/C2/displays.config".
