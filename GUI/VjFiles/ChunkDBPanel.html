<h2><img src="juggler.gif"></img>Working with Config Files</h2>

You can load and edit VR Juggler Config Files by clicking on the 
"Configure" tab of the main window.  This displays a panel that
is divided into two similar parts.  The idea is that you can
view one file on each side, making it easy to compare two files
and to copy Chunks back and forth between them.

<p>
At the top of each panel is a ComboBox that lets you choose which of the
loaded config files to display.  The selected file will appear in a
tree format in the middle of the panel.  Click on a Chunk in the tree
to select it.  You can double-click
on a chunk to view or edit it.

<p>
There are eight buttons along the side of each panel:

<ul>
<li>New - creates a new (empty) config file.
<li>Load - loads a config file and views it in this panel.
<li>Save - save the config file currently being viewed.  Note that this
button always opens a file dialog, so it's technically Save As...
<li>Close - removes the currently viewed config file from memory.
<b>WARNING!</b> VjControl does not currently warn you if you close a
file without saving it.

<li><< or >> - copies all selected chunks in this file to the file
being viewed in the other panel.
<li><All< or >All> - copies every chunk in this file to the file being
viewed in the other file.
<li>Remove - deletes all selected chunks in the currently viewed file.
<li>Insert - inserts a new chunk.  The type of chunk to insert is determined
by the Insert Type combo box at the bottom of the panel.

</ul>
