The PerfDataBufferTest program is a sanity check and
performance measurement test for the vjPerfDataBuffer
class which forms the basis of much of Juggler's
performance monitoring abilities.

While it instantiates a Juggler kernel it never actually
starts it, and doesn't need or use a configuration file.

It outputs the resolution of the timer used and times
the vjPerfDataBuffer::set function by calling it 7000
times (only the middle 5000 sets are used for calculating
averages etc.)

It also prints a list of discrepencies - data points that
are more than twice the average value.  Usually these are
the result of paging, task switches, or other system
activity.
