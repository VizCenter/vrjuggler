The Analyzer java program reads in a juggler performance output file
and prints information about average times and lists anomalies.

COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS:

java Analyzer [args] filename

-noanomaly - don't bother to print out the list of anomalous data points
-skipfirst x - skip the first x loops of data (default = 10)
-skiplast x - skip the last x loops of data (default = 10)
-anomalycutoff x - defines anomalous data points to be those + or -
         x % from the average for their index.  (default = 100%)

NOTES

- You'll probably need to run the program from the directory containing
the .class files. Sorry, no .jar & script files tonight.

- The total loop average time may not be exactly the same as the sum
of the time averages for the individual indices.  This is because
in calculating the total loop time, we only include loops for which
we have a complete set of samples.

- The program might choke on large input files with lots of anomalies.
If this happens, use the -noanomaly option or use -anomalycutoff to 
set a higher cutoff, and let me know (the fix is trivial but annoying).
