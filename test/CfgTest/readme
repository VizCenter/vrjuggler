CfgTest tests the integrity of the configuration classes - ConfigChunkDB,
ChunkDescDB, VarValue, etc.

CfgTest works by reading two data files, chunks and config.  Reading them
will check for parse errors and the ability to recover from errors
(the file config includes several errors).  It then queries the ConfigChunkDB
and tries some simple gets and sets of values in the DB.

The file output.correct shows what the output of CfgTest _ought_ to look
like, including the error messages that should be generated.
