 * application classes should be derived from.  The interface
 * given is the interface that the System expects in order to
 * interface with the application.<br> <br>
 *
 * <h3> The control loop will look similar to this: </h3>
 *  NOTE: One time through the loop is a Juggler Frame <br>
 *
 * \code
 *  contextInit();                 // called for each context                 
 *  while (drawing)                                 
 *  {

 *     <b>bufferPreDraw();</b>     // called for each draw buffer
 *     <b>contextPreDraw();</b>    // called for each context
 *     <b>draw();</b>              // called for each surfacewindow
 *     <b>contextPostDraw();</b>   // called for each context
 *     intraFrame();               // called in parallel to the draw functions.
 *     sync();
 *     postFrame();
 *
