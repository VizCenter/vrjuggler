 *
 *     This class defines the class that all API specific
 *  application classes should be derived from.  The interface
 *  given is the interface that the Kernel expects in order to
 *  interface with the application.  Most of the application's
 *  interface will be defined in the derived API specific classes.
 *
 *  Users should sub-class the API specific classes to create
 *  user-defined applications.  A user application is required
 *  to provide function definitions for any of the virual functions
 *  that the application needs to use.  This is the method that
 *  the application programmer uses to interface with VR Juggler.
 *
 *  The control loop will look similar to this: <br> <br>
 *  @note One time through the loop is a Juggler Frame <br>
 *
 *  while (drawing)           <br>
 *  {                         <br>
