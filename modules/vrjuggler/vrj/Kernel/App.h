/** \class App App.h vrj/Kernel/App.h
 *
 * Encapsulates the actual application.
 *
 * This defines the base class for all graphics API-specific application
 * object types.  The interface given is what the VR Juggler kernel expects in
 * order to communicate with the application.  Most of the application's
 * interface will be defined in the derived graphics API-specific classes.
 *
 * Users should write their application objectcs as subclasses of the graphics
 * API-specific classes.  Overriding the virtual functions in this class and
 * in the graphics API-specific subclasses is the method by which the
 * application programmer interfaces with VR Juggler.
 *
 * The VR Juggler kernel control loop will look similar to this:
 *
 * \code
 * while (drawing)
 * {
 *    <b>app_obj->preFrame()</b>;
 *    <b>app_obj->latePreFrame()</b>;
 *    draw();
 *    <b>app_obj->intraFrame()</b>;
 *    sync();
 *    <b>app_obj->postFrame()</b>;
 *
 *    updateAllDevices();
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * @note One time through the loop is a Juggler Frame.
