TODO for the [VR Juggler -> audiojuggler] adaptor...


[8.30.2001]
everything is offloaded to sonix, look there for more info.

Is there anything the SoundManager should do in addition to configure
sonix with config chunks?  

TODO: - look at update and sync funcs

get OpenAL working on IRIX.....
write the OpenAL wrapper.


[5.10.2000]

lots...


use some standard config file format such as XML or VRJuggler's configchunks.
  (this would mean splitting out juggler's config chunks first...)
  
not all things are supported such as looping of sounds, enable etc..

this lib implements only a limited subset of the each sound api... expand it.
