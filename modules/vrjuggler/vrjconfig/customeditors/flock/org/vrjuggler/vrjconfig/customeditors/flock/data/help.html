   <h2>Flock of Birds&reg; configuration steps:</h2>

   <ol>
      <li>
         Set the serial port to which the Flock of Birds is connected.
      </li>
      <li>
         Set the baud for the serial port.
      </li>
      <li>
         Set the hemisphere of the transmitter within which the user(s) will
         be operating.
      </li>
      <li>
         Set the Fast Bird Bus (FBB) address of the master bird.  This is
         determined by the DIP switch settings on the birds.  With EPROM
         version 3.67 or newer, this value will be detected automatically by
         the device driver.  Otherwise, it must be set correctly here.
      </li>
      <li>
         Set the addressing mode.  This will depend on the type of Flock
         hardware being used.  With EPROM verrsion 3.67 or newer, this value
         will be detected automatically by the device driver.  Otherwise, it
         must be set correctly here.
      </li>
      <li>
         Set the filter.  This value is currently <i>ignored</i> by the device
         driver.
      </li>
      <li>
         <i>CLUSTER ONLY</i>: Set the cluster node where the Flock of
         Birds&reg; is physically attached.  This determines which node
         will run the device driver.
      </li>
   </ol>

   <h3>Transmitter Settings</h3>

   <p>
      Under the <b>Transmitter</b>, you will find the settings for the
      placement of the Flock of Birds&reg; transmitter (a small white cube
      or a big, heavy black box).  The orientation and position of the
      transmitter are configured relative to the VR Juggler coordinate frame.
      Remember that the transmitter coordinate frame has negative X coming
      out of the face with the power cord  and positive Y to the left of the
      front face.  Refer to Page 142 of the <i>Flock of Birds&reg;
      Installation and Operation Guide</i> (910141 Rev A1, published January
      31, 2002).
   </p>

   <ol>
      <li>
         Set the physical units of the data returned by the sensors.
         Currently, the Flock of Birds tracking system <i>only</i> returns
         inches, but the device driver always reinterprets this as
         <b>Feet</b>.  Therefore, <b>Feet</b> must be chosen.
      </li>
      <li>
         Configure the position and orientation of the Flock of Birds&reg;
         transmitter (the large black box) relative to the VR Juggler
         coordinate frame.  This process configures what is known as a
         "position transform filter."  The panels titled "Orientation" and
         "Position" present an easy way to perform this task.

         <p>
            First, choose the coordinate frame rotation from the
            <b>Transmitter Coordinate Frame</b> list.  To enter the X, Y, and
            Z rotation values directly, click the <b>Manual Entry</b> button
            and fill in the values to the right of the list.
         </p>

         <p>
            Next, set the position of the transmitter relative to the
            chosen VR Juggler origin.  The units can be entered as
            meters, centimeters, feet, or inches.  Make sure to pick the
            units before entering the location value.
