Overview
--------

This example creates a VNC desktop viewer and draws it using OpenGL.

The example allows the user to grab, move, and resize the VNC desktop
interactively.

This is not meant to be a full application but is only meant to show how
VNC could be used inside a user application.

Please note that vrj_vnc_app.jdef configuration definition file in the
local directory.  It is used to create a config element that is needed to
configure the application with the correct VNC desktop parameters.  This
is optional in end-user applications, but is provided with this sample to
make it easier to customize the applciation.  In order for VRJConfig and
VR Juggler to find vrj_vnc_app.jdef, the environment variable
$JCCL_DEFINITION_PATH must be set to include this directory.  In the
examples below, <example-dir> represents the absolute path to this
directory.  On UNIX-based platforms, set $JCCL_DEFINITION_PATH to the
following value:

   $VJ_BASE_DIR/share/vrjuggler/data/definitions:<example-dir>

On Windows, it must be set to:

   %VJ_BASE_DIR%\share\vrjuggler\data\definitions;<example-dir>
