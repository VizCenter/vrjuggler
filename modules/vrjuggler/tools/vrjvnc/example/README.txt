Overview
--------

This example creates a VNC desktop viewer and draws it using OpenGL.

The example allows the user to grab, move, and resize the VNC desktop
interactively.

This is not meant to be a full application but is only meant to show how
VNC could be used inside a user application.

Please note that vrjvnc.desc configuration description file in the local
directory.  It is used to create a configuration chunk that is needed to
configure the application with the correct vnc desktop parameters.  This
is optional in end-user applications, but is provided with this sample to
make it easier to customize the applciation.
