<h2>Environment Manager Chunk</h2>

The Environment Manager is the part of a VR Juggler application which connects
to outside control and data-gathering programs, most notably the VjControl 
configuration editor.

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td align="right">
      <b>Environment Manager</b>
    </td>
    <td>
      Chunk token: ``<tt>EnvironmentManager</tt>''<br>
      Configures the network settings for the Environment Manager and
      controls which features are activated.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">
      <b>Port</b>
    </td>
    <td>
      Tells VR Juggler what network port to listen for connections on.  A
      reasonable default value is port 4450.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">
      <b>Accept Connections</b>
    </td>
    <td>
      Tells VR Juggler whether or not it should open the network port and
      accept connections.  If this is set to false, VjControl will be unable
      to connect to the Juggler application.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">
      <b>Performance Target</b>
    </td>
    <td>
      This field tells Juggler where to send the performance data it gathers.
      The result is either a <a href="FileConnect.html">File Connection</a>
      or a Network Connection.  Note that currently the Network
      Connection is not fully implemented.
