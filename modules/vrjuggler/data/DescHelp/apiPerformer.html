      The full path to the model used for the head.  This is a string value,
      and as the name of a file, it depends upon the underlying file system
      for its syntax.  On UNIX, file names are case sensitive, and
      directories are separated by the `<TT>/</TT>' character.  On Win32-based
      systems, file names are <I>not</I> case sensitive, and directories are
      separated by the `<TT>\</TT>' character.
