                           ------------------------

For all versions:

    - See the ChangeLog for more system-level changes that do not directly
      affect applications.
    - See the Known Bugs page on the VR Juggler website (www.vrjuggler.org)
      for the current list of bugs.

===============================================================================

 Version: 2.0 Alpha 1 (1.1.135)
Released: March 15, 2003

    Please refer to the following to get started with VR Juggler 2.0 Alpha 1:

       http://www.vrjuggler.org/vrjuggler/2.0-alpha1/migration.guide/

    Required application and configuration changes for upgrading from all
    previous versions (including 1.1.x up through 1.1 DR3):
        * Gadgeteer loads device drivers on demand now.  An InputManager
          chunk must be added to tell the Input Manager what driver(s) to
          load at runtime.  For example, to load the Flock of Birds driver
          and the Immersion IBox driver on a UNIX system, add the following
          to the appropriate configuration file:

            <InputManager name="Input Manager">
              <driver>${VJ_BASE_DIR}/lib/gadgeteer/drivers/Flock_drv.so</driver>
              <driver>${VJ_BASE_DIR}/lib/gadgeteer/drivers/IBox_drv.so</driver>
            </InputManager>

          On Win32, it would appear as:

            <InputManager name="Input Manager">
              <driver>${VJ_BASE_DIR}/lib/gadgeteer/drivers/Flock_drv.dll</driver>
              <driver>${VJ_BASE_DIR}/lib/gadgeteer/drivers/IBox_drv.dll</driver>
            </InputManager>

          All drivers except simulator devices and keyboards must be loaded
          this way on all platforms.  For multiple instances of these, be
          sure to name each <InputManager> block uniquely.
        * In configuration files, all values representing physical units
          (corner positions, translation values, etc.) must be specified in
          meters.
        * All position devices now use a list of filters to transform the
          positional data read from the device.  Correct configuration of
          a device's filter(s) is necessary to inform the Gadgeteer Input
          Manager of what units (feet, inches, meters) the device driver
          returns.
        * gadget::PositionInterface::getData() now returns a copy of a
          gmtl::Matrix44f instead of a pointer to the object.  The method
          also takes an optional argument that tells what measurement units
          the application wants.  The default is feet.

 Version: 1.1 DR3 (1.1.128)
Released: September 29, 2002

    Please refer to the following to get started with VR Juggler 1.1 DR3:

       http://www.vrjuggler.org/vrjuggler/1.1-DR3/migration.guide/

    Required application and configuration changes for upgrading from all
    previous versions (including 1.1.x up through 1.1 DR2):
        * The configuration file format has changed to an XML-based format.
          There is an upgrade path using the cfgupdater script and various
          XSLT stylesheets. Please follow the steps in the Migration Guide
          for further details.

 Version: 1.1 DR2 (1.1.126)
Released: September 6, 2002

    Please refer to the following to get started with VR Juggler 1.1 DR2:

       http://www.vrjuggler.org/vrjuggler/1.1-DR2/migration.guide/

 Version: 1.1 DR1 (1.1.96)
Released: June 13, 2002

    Please refer to the following to get started with VR Juggler 1.1 DR1:

       http://www.vrjuggler.org/vrjuggler/1.1-DR1/migration.guide/

 Version: 1.1.92 (dev build)
Released: April 10, 2002

    Required application and configuration changes for upgrading from all
    previous versions (including 1.1.x up through 1.1.91):
        * The directory containing miscellaneous data files has been
          renamed from "Data" to "data".

 Version: 1.1.91 (dev build)
Released: October 16, 2001

    Required application and configuration changes for upgrading from all
    previous versions (including 1.1.x up through 1.1.90):
        * The script juggler-config is now called vrjuggler-config.
        * vjDEBUG has been replaced with vprDEBUG.  The levels and
          categories are now prefixed with "vrj" instead of "vj".  The
          category formerly called vjDBG_ALL is now vprDBG_ALL.

 Version: 1.1.90 (dev build)
Released: September 21, 2001

    Required application changes for upgrading from all previous versions
    (including 1.1.x up through 1.1.89):
        * The directory structure for the source tree has been completely
          reorganized.  All source and header files are now rooted in the
          vrj directory.  The Kernel directory has been separated into
          "Kernel", "Draw", and "Displays".  The Draw directory now contains
          the API-specific application headers in the directories OGL (for
          OpenGL), OSG (for OpenScenegraph), and Pf (for Performer).  In
          addition, the files and classes no longer have the "vj" prefix
          because the vrj namespace has been put into use.  Easy upgrading
          from 1.0 and 1.1.x builds prior to 1.1.90 can be done using the
          compatibility headers in the "deprecated" tree.  Simply add
          -I$(VJ_BASE_DIR)/include/deprecated to your application's makefile
          and recompile.  For a complete upgrade to the new structure and
          naming convention, consult the following web page:

 Version: 1.1 (dev build)
Started: April 13, 2001

    Required application and configuration changes for upgrading from older
    versions:
        * Introduced window viewports.  This means all config files from old
          version are incompatible.  The new chunk type to use is displayWindow.
          The old chunk types (simDisplay & surfaceDisplay) can not be used.
        * vjGlApp::bufferPreDraw() - New interface function for OpenGL-based
          apps.  Must use if going to use multiviewport code.

        * Performer now has some support for run-time reconfiguration.  This 
          has the following new implications:
            - numpipes must be set correctly in the display config chunk
            - Sometimes black windows will appear on unused pipes.
        * Performer applications running on Linux must use the pfStat library
          in tools/pfStatLinux otherwise there will be an unresolved symbol
          when running applications.  This is due to a bug in Linux performer.

===============================================================================

 Version: 1.0.0
Released: April 13, 2001

    Required application and configuration changes for upgrading from older
    beta versions:
        * Interocular distance is now a configurable option.  If not given,
          the default separation will be 0.0 which results in no stereo
          viewing.  A recommended value for most cases is 0.229.  This is
          set in the JugglerUser chunk.
        * Link Juggler_utils when compiling applications.
        * The method vjQuat::unit() is now called vjQuat::normalizeFast().
        * The method vjQuat::makeQuat() is now called vjQuat::makeRot().
        * Update the descfiles property in ~/.vjconfig/vjcontrol.cfg (if one
          exists) to point to "$VJ_SHARE_DIR/Data/chunksDesc".  This is
          necessary because the extra VR Juggler files are now installed in
          $VJ_BASE_DIR/share by default instead of $VJ_BASE_DIR.  Note that
          $VJ_SHARE_DIR is a value used internally by VjControl and does
          not have to be set as an environment variable.
        * On IRIX with the MIPSpro Compilers, -LANG:std must be added to the
          compiler and linker options for compiling applications.
        * On IRIX, the version 7.3.1.1m or newer of the MIPSpro Compilers is
          required.  Check your version with 'CC -version' on the command
          line.
        * The Ascension MotionStar driver has been improved, and configuration
          files for that device must be updated.  Refer to the examples in
          $VJ_BASE_DIR/share/Data/configFiles/example.mstar.1pack.config and
          $VJ_BASE_DIR/share/Data/configFiles/example.mstar.2pack.config for
          one- and two-pack configurations respectively.
        * All windows are positioned relative to the lower left corner of
          the display area.  This allows all graphics APIs on all platforms
          to use the same display configuration.

    New features:
        * The field of view (FOV) and aspect ratio can now be configured in
          simulator windows.
        * Drivers for trackd and the Intersense IS-900 have been added.
        * Many memory problems and instability issues have been fixed.
        * Win32 support has been improved.  All windows are positioned
          correctly, and borderless surface displays can be opened.


===============================================================================

 Version: 0.1.97
Released: July 18, 2000

    Required application and configuration changes for upgrading from 0.1.95:
        * Link Juggler_utils
        * Keyboard chunk in config files should have sleep_time set to a
          non-zero value.  50 is a reasonable value.  Failing to do so can
          result in a major performance decrease.
        * All windows are positioned with a coordinate system based at the
          lower left corner of the window relative to the lower left corner
          of the display.  Full screen windows should be placed at 0,0.
        * vjGetVJMatrix() (in Kernel/Pf/vjPfUtil.h) been renamed to
          vjGetVjMatrix().

    New features:
        * Debugging output can be color coded for easier readability.  This
          is currently only available with the UNIX versions.
        * Many bug fixes that include fixing some bad memory references.
        * Pinch glove driver is now supported and has a digital simulator.
        * MotionStar driver is working but still has some limitations (see
          the Known Bugs page).
        * The samples/pf directory has a VR Juggler application to load
          models into Performer that supports nagivation and collision
          detection.
        * The vjMatrix class has three new members for getting rotation
          values: getXRot(), getYRot() and getZRot().
        * Applications no longer need to pass a kernel instance to their
          VR Juggler App super class.  The vjApp class will get a vjKernel
          instance on its own if none is provided.  If, however, a kernel
          instance is provided and it is NULL, a fatal error will still
          occur.
        * SoundManager is available to abstract sound functionality for 
          cross platform audio.

    VjControl now requires the Java 2 compiler and runtime environment.
