DATE       AUTHOR   CHANGE
---------- -------- -----------------------------------------------------------
2002-06-07 patrickh Moved the object serialization code from Plexus to VPR.
                    NEW VERSION: 0.16.0
2002-06-04 patrickh The process of making symlinks to juggler/external/boost
                    during the build process and of installing Boost has been
                    moved over to the juggler/external mini build system.
2002-05-31 patrickh Added vpr::InetAddr::getLocalHost().
                    NEW VERSION: 0.15.1
2002-05-30 allenb   Auto-register debug categories and changed the format of 
                    debug category objects.
                    This should help fix the long standing issues of startup 
                    intialization and ordering involved in the debug output 
                    categories.
                    NEW VERSION: 0.15.0
2002-05-29 patrickh Fixed API for vpr::RWMutexNSPR to match vpr::RWMutex.
                    NEW VERSION: 0.14.1
2002-05-24 allenb   Updated Debug to have a disallowed category list.  This
                    lets the user specify categories to ignore.
2002-05-23 patrickh In an effort to get the Juggler suite of tools compiling
                    with GCC 3.1, specializations of std::hash<T> for
                    vpr::InetAddr, vpr::Uint64, and vpr::GUID have been
                    removed.  Hashers called vpr::InetAddr::hash,
                    vpr::Uint64Hash, and vpr::GUID::hash have been added
                    instead.
                    NEW VERSION: 0.14.0
2002-05-22 allenb   Updated to work with Boost 0.1.28.
2002-04-26 patrickh Turned on versioning in shared library names.
2002-04-16 allenb   Added vpr::Error which can be used to output
           patrickh subsystem-specific (i.e., OS-specific) error messages.
                    NEW VERSION: 0.13.2
2002-04-09 patrickh Extended vpr::Interval to include methods for converting
                    the interval value to double-precision floating-point
                    values.
                    NEW VERSION: 0.13.1
2002-04-06 allenb   Removed template template from generic factory class,
                    since Irix can't handle template templates.
2002-04-06 allenb   Smarter testing for invalid char* passed to GUID.
2002-04-03 allenb   Fixed bug in replaceEnvVars.  Removed ThreadTest from suite
                    because of threading bugs in exception handling.
                    NEW VERSION: 0.13.0
2002-04-02 allenb   Added replaceEnvVars function for replacing environment
                    variables in a given string.
2002-03-28 patrickh Turned on exceptions by default when using GCC 3.  This is
                    in line with behavior of all other supported compilers.
2002-03-13 patrickh Fixed vpr::Interval time calculations on Win32.
                    NEW VERSION: 0.11.4
2002-02-24 allenb   Added Factory Pattern template class.
2002-02-16 patrickh Turned off the zeroing out of serial port attributes when
                    opening a new port except when building on IRIX.  If the
                    attributes are zeroed out on Linux, the port cannot be
                    re-opened after being closed.
                    NEW VERSION: 0.11.2
2002-02-16 patrickh Added methods to vpr::SerialPort that enable and disable
                    "hardware" flow control.
                    NEW VERSION: 0.11.1
2002-01-28 patrickh Updated synchronization primitive classes to return
                    vpr::ReturnStatus objects instead of integers.
                    NEW VERSION: 0.11.0
2001-01-10 allenb   Fixed up the debug output category filters.
                    Added category prefix settings.
                    NEW VERSION: 0.10.1
2002-01-10 patrickh Reverted vpr::BaseIOStatsStrategy back to a normal class
                    rather than a templatized class (see version 0.5.0 below).
                    NEW VERSION: 0.10.0
2001-01-07 patrickh When a sim socket closes, undelivered messages are flushed
                    from the network.
2002-01-03 patrickh Added support for connection initiation events, connection
                    completion events, and localhost message delivery events
                    to the socket simulator code.
                    NEW VERSION: 0.9.1
2002-01-02 patrickh Rewrote the build system for the test suite so that it can
                    use .cpp files instead of having everything in .h files.
2002-01-02 allenb   vpr::Interval now uses a Uint64 value internally.  This 
                    eliminates the issue of wrapping that existed in the old
                    method.
2002-01-01 allenb   Fixed vpr::Interval::operator<().
2001-12-31 patrickh Sim sockets have had major overhauls that improve
                    performance, stability, and functionality.
                    NEW VERSION: 0.9.0
2001-12-31 allenb   Added interface isBound() to Socket_t and Socket impls.
2001-12-30 allenb   Complete rewrite of sim::SocketManager and many of the
                    associated sim classes.
2001-12-27 allenb   Added setNowReal() method to vpr::Interval.
                    NEW VERSION: 0.8.4
2001-12-20 patrickh vpr::InetAddr now has getHostname() and getHostnames() that
                    return the hostname(s) for a given address.
                    NEW VERSION: 0.8.3
2001-12-20 patrickh POSIX sockets have caught up to NSPR sockets again.
                    NEW VERSION: 0.8.2
2001-12-19 patrickh Support for building a profiled VPR library has been added.
2001-12-13 patrickh The simulated Socket Manager separates the binding of UDP
                    and TCP sockets.
                    NEW VERSION: 0.8.1
2001-12-13 patrickh The simulator clock now operates in vpr::Intervals so that
                    it can take advantage of the built-in base time and
                    roll-over capabilities.
                    NEW VERSION: 0.8.0
2001-12-13 patrickh Users can define a "pause time" in between events in the
                    simulation controller.
                    NEW VERSION: 0.7.1
2001-12-13 allenb   Added method to get the value of the "base" type of 
                    vpr::Interval.  This is to assist in serializing the data.
2001-12-13 allenb   Added availableBytes() to the BlockIO interface.
                    NEW VERSION: 0.7.0
2001-12-11 allenb   Added debugOutputGuard to vpr::Debug.  Helps with scoped
                    debug output.
                    NEW VERSION: 0.6.2
2001-12-11 allenb   Added new return status: NotConnected. Read and write on 
                    sockets can (should) return this status when the socket 
                    being used has lost it's connection to the socket on the
                    other side.
                    NEW VERSION: 0.6.1
2001-12-10 patrickh The simulation controller is now a thread-specific
                    singleton with a clock.  The clock is used for keeping
                    track of time in the simulation.  The Socket Manager is no
                    longer a singleton so that there may be one associated with
                    each simulation controller instance.
2001-12-09 patrickh Added socket/network simulator code.  This can be
                    compiled instead of "real" sockets using the new
                    --enable-simuatlor configure option.
                    NEW VERSION: 0.6.0
2001-12-09 patrickh Disallowed the overriding of the VPR "domain" (the thing
                    that defines what sockets, threads, etc. to use) by user
                    code.  The class vpr::BaseIOStatsStrategy is now a
                    templatized class.
                    NEW VERSION: 0.5.0
2001-12-07 allenb   GUID now has a constructor that can use a dispatch tag
                    to specify that it should generate a new id an init time.
2001-12-05 allenb   GUID's default constructor now initialized it to NullGUID.
2001-11-21 allenb   Modified StatCollector to allow for time based and discrete
                    stat collection.
2001-11-20 allenb   Created standards StatCollector class for collecting
                    IO statistics.  Replaced the old BandwidthIOStats
                    collection method with the new collector class.
2001-11-15 allenb   Added valid() test function to thread functors.  The code
                    now tries to test for valid functors at thread creation.
                    Also added destructor that sets the internal values to ones
                    that can be easily detected by isValid().
2001-11-13 allenb   Changed the debug GUID category registrators to allow only
                    one registration of the GUIDs.  This means that the 
                    registration macro should only be used from .cpp files now
2001-10-12 allenb   Updated vapor debug to use GUIDs for category identifiers.
                    This allows other systems to extend the categories.
2001-09-23 patrick  Updated test suite to use CppUnit 1.6.0.
2001-09-12 alleb    Added wait interval to the cond var abstractions.
           patrick
2001-09-04 kevn     vpr::ReturnStatus::Success renamed to
                    vpr::ReturnStatus::Succeed; vpr::ReturnStatus::Failure
                    renamed to vpr::ReturnStatus::Fail.
2001-08-06 allenb   Test case for vpr::System added.
2001-08-06 allenb   Introduced Htonll and Ntohll.
2001-07-31 patrick  Fixed major problems with SocketImplBSD::isConnected() and
                    with FileHandleImplUNIX::is{Redable,Writeable}().  These
                    methods now work properly.
2001-07-27 patrick  Removed the compiler flags dealing with warnings from the
                    output of 'vpr-config --cxxflags'.
2001-07-24 allenb   Changed socket bridge templates to use boost::shared_ptr
                    to reference the impl sockets.  This change introduces
                    reference counting on the impl sockets and makes
                    memory management much easier to handle.
2001-07-24 allenb   Added destructor code to SocketNSPRImpl.
2001-07-23 allenb   Added vprTest::BoostTest for testing boost functionality
                    required for vapor and other Juggler libs.
2001-07-22 allenb   Replace vpr::Status with vpr::ReturnStatus
2001-07-21 allenb   Imported Boost 1.0.23. ( www.boost.org )
2001-07-20 patrick  The vpr::Socket connect() method now uses its timeout to
                    wait for the connection to complete on a non-blocking
                    socket.
2001-07-20 allenb   The broken semantics of vpr::SocketConnector when using
                    non-blocking sockets have been corrected.
2001-07-17 patrick  Read/write calls take a vpr::Uint32 for their by-reference
                    out parameter giving the number of bytes read or written.
2001-07-13 patrick  Read/write calls return vpr::Status::WouldBlock instead of
                    vpr::Status::InProgress for non-blocking configurations.
2001-07-12 patrick  The internal platform-specific I/O implementation classes
                    no longer inherit from vpr::BlockIO.
2001-06-28 patrick  Non-blocking socket support (mostly) added.
2001-06-25 allenb   Added timeout interval param to nearly every I/O
                    method in the library.
2001-06-24 allenb   Added vpr::Interval class
2001-06-21 patrick  Completed work needed to build a DLL on Win32.
2001-06-21 browner  Added a wrapper around the serial device API on Win32.
                    This completes what is needed to allow writing
                    cross-platform serial device drivers.
2001-06-20 patrick  Complete restructuring of the directory tree.  This
                    included the removal of the SharedMem directory, the
                    renaming of the directories Threads and Utils to Thread
                    and Util respectively, and the requirement of prefixing
                    all included VPR headers with "vpr/".  The module was also
                    renamed from vpr to vapor.  While all revision history has
                    been retained, no code checked out prior to the tag
                    POST_DIRECTORY_RESTRUCTURE will compile.
2001-05-22 patrick  Brought the termios wrapper up to speed with the changes
                    made to the Bridge pattern implementation.  Templates are
                    used now instead of pure virtual methods.
2001-04-20 allenb   NSPR subsystem extended to wrap NSPR sockets.
2001-04-19 patrick  Changed the socket classes using the Bridge pattern to use
                    templates rather than pure virtual methods.  This was done
                    to help with maintenance and with general performance.
2001-04-17 patrick  Using the version of the VPR directory in the VR Juggler
                    source tree as the basis, the code was broken into a
                    separtely evolving module.
