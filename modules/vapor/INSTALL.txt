2. Compiling the VR Juggler Portable Runtime
==============================================================================

    A. Steps

          i. Choose a directory to put the VR Juggler Portable Runtime source
             code (referred to as <VPR_DIR> from now on).

         ii. Go to that directory and checkout VR Juggler Portable Runtime
             using CVS
             NOTE: make sure CVS is set up, and pointing to the VR Juggler
             Portable Runtime repository.

            The simple version is:

                cd <VPR_DIR>
                cvs checkout vapor

        iii. Enter the newly checked out VPR source directory

                cd <VPR_DIR>/vapor

         iv. Compile the VR Juggler Portable Runtime (using the Autoconf
             system and GNU make)

              a. Generate aclocal.m4, header template (vprDefines.h.in), and
                 the configure script

                    ./autogen.sh
    
              b. Probe the system for capabilities, generate Makefiles, etc.
                 (this configures the source tree for the current system)

                    ./configure

              c. Make the distribution using GNU make.  This compiles, links,
                 and creates the final distribution tree (in the form of
                 symlinks)

                    gmake

          v. Set the environment variable $VPR_BASE_DIR.  This is *required*
             by VPR's application makefiles and runtime environment.

             NOTES:
                 1. The directory "instlinks" is semi-important. 
                    It is a working distribution of the VR Juggler Portable
                    Runtime library.  After "gmake" is done, you'll be able
                    to use this directory to compile and link your
                    application code.  This will not work on Win32, so a
                    full installation must be performed.
                 2. It is helpful to have something similar to the following
                    line your $HOME/.tcshrc or $HOME/.cshrc file (assuming
                    the use of tcsh for your shell):

                        setenv VPR_BASE_DIR [VPR_DIR]/vapor/instlinks

                    Use whatever is appropriate for your shell (BASH, ksh,
                    DOS, etc.)

    B. Options for the configure script

       To get a list of options that can be passed to the configure script,
       execute the following in <VPR_DIR>/vapor:

           ./configure --help

    C. Advanced topics

       Sending compiler output to a different directory than the source
       tree can be helpful for debugging and development.  This is done
       by making a directory to put the object files and compiled
       libraries before building.

       The following steps set up a build directory within your VR Juggler
       Portable Runtime source directory.  Here, we use the name <BUILD_DIR>
       to refer to the directory that will contain the object files and
       libraries.  It can be called whatever you want.

           mkdir <VPR_DIR>/vapor/<BUILD_DIR>
           cd <VPR_DIR>/vapor/<BUILD_DIR>
           <VPR_DIR>/vapor/configure
