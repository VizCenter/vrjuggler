    * reference countable memory. (no, not radio controlled, sorry)
    *
    * To use reference counting on your objects, inherit from this class.
    *
    * NOTES:
    * - you MUST call unrefDelete or checkDelete to delete, do not call 
    *   operator::delete() yourself!!!!!
    * - on creation, refcount == 0, so if you intend to own the memory 
    *   created, you should call ref() on the object
    *
    * EXAMPLE USAGE:
    *   Object obj;
    *   obj.ref();  // count == 1;
    *   obj.ref();  // count == 2;
    *   int count = obj.getRef();
    *   obj.unrefDelete(); // count == 1, memory is not deleted
    *   obj.unrefDelete(); // count == 0, memory is deleted
