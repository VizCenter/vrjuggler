DATE        AUTHOR      CHANGE
----------- ----------- -------------------------------------------------------
Apr-19-2009 patrick     Added handling of mouse scroll events in the X and Y
                        axes as first class mouse events. For the old behavior
                        of treating them as button presses, recognizing left
                        and right scrolling has been added.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.3.22
Mar-24-2009 patrick     Allow mouse locking in keyboard/mouse input areas to be
		        disabled through the configuration.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.3.21
Apr-18-2008 patrick     Added gadget::FullPositionXformFilter.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.3.20
Feb-25-2008 dshipton    Refactored cluster networking to eliminate cosstly
                        back-to-back writes.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.3.19
Dec-30-2007 patrick     Moved analog data normalization to gadget::AnalogProxy
                        so that analog device drivers need not perform any
                        normalization of data read from the hardware. The raw,
                        unormalized analog data can now be queried using
                        gadget::AnalogProxy::getRawData(). The data returned by
                        gadget::Analog::getAnalogDataBuffer() is no longer
                        normalized.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.3.18
Dec-30-2007 patrick     Improved const correctness for most input-related
                        classes. This should not break any existing code, but
                        some code could reduce data copying by using const
                        references to returned data.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.3.17
Nov-18-2007 patrick     The X,Y position for mouse events is now reported
                        using a lower left-hand corner origin to match the
                        window positioning convention of Juggler.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.3.16
Nov-18-2007 patrick     Replaced gadget::InputAreaCocoa::updateOriginAndSize()
                        with gadget::InputAreaCocoa::resize().
                        NEW VERSION: 1.3.15
Sep-04-2007 patrick     Use new environment variable GADGET_DATA_DIR as a way
                        to look up files in GADGET_BASE_DIR/share/gadgeteer.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.3.14
Sep-04-2007 patrick     Set GADGET_BASE_DIR automatically on all platforms.
Jul-28-2007 aronb       Fixed device sharing in cluster configurations.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.3.13
Jul-08-2007 patrick     Debug-enabled code linked against the release runtime
                        on Windows is now named the same as optimized code.
                        The debug DLLs are installed in the "debug"
                        subdirectory. On non-Windows platforms, debug-enabled
                        plug-ins no longer use the "_d" name variation and are
                        installed in the "debug" subdirectory.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.3.12
Jun-27-2007 patrick     Removed the need for overriding operator delete in
                        subclasses of gadget::Input.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.3.11
Jun-26-2007 patrick     Changed the preprocessor identification of debug versus
                        optimized to look for GADGET_DEBUG or JUGGLER_DEBUG
                        instead of _DEBUG (and GADGET_OPT or JUGGLER_OPT
                        instead of _OPT).
                        NEW VERSION: 1.3.10
Jun-15-2007 aronb       Introduced typedefs for known gadget::InputMixer<>
                        instantiations to be used as the base class for device
                        drivers.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.3.8
Jun-15-2007 aronb       Fixed the VRPN driver so that it works correctly in a
                        cluster configuration again.
May-08-2007 aronb       Simplify the cluster archetecture and use ::create()
                        factory methods.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.3.7
May-01-2007 aronb       Start using shared_ptrs for gadget::Node and
                        cluster::Packet.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.3.6

                        NEW VERSION: 1.3.5
May-01-2007 aronb       Start using shared_ptrs for Input, Digital, Analog,
                        Position, etc.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.3.4
Apr-30-2007 aronb       Started revamping the cluster infastructure.
