Sep-13-2002 aronb     gadget::Input no longer defines member variables for the
                      port name and baud rate of a device.  The individual

                      the new JCCL config chunk API.  These changes have not

                      not in the window.  
                      This class has also been refactored so that
                      subclasses of it can create their own windows and
                      still get window event input.
