Nov-17-2003 patrickh    The factory function for remote run-time
                        reconfiguration plug-ins now take a parameter that is
                        of type jccl::ConfigManager*.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.15.0
Nov-09-2003 patrickh    Refactored the CORBA-based remote run-time

                        Among other things, this officially renames "config
                        chunk" to "config element" and "chunk desc" to
                        "config definition."  The configuration and definition

                        NEW VERSION: 0.10.1
Apr-09-2003 nonchocoboy Embedded chunks may now be heterogenously defined. The
                        allowed types list is used to specify which types of

                        operators.  Commented out old un-used dependency
                        sorting method.
Feb-27-2003 nonchocoboy Added a version property to both config chunks and
                        chunk descs to be used for future work.
                        Bumped desc file format version to 2.3.
                        Bumped config file format version to 2.2.
Feb-21-2003 allenb      Fixed bug where chunks with invalid descs would cause
                        assertions.
                        This fix also introduces a new method for initializaing
                        chunks from XML nodes.
Jan-23-2003 nonchocoboy Removed jccl-chunks.desc.
Jan-15-2003 nonchocoboy Description files now use a new "allowedtype" token
                        rather than overloading the "enumeration" token to
                        specify allowed chunk types for embedded chunks and
                        chunk pointers. Bumped desc file format version to 2.2.
Jan-15-2003 nonchocoboy VarValue is dead.

Sep-23-2002 nonchocoboy DataSources are reference counted in the ConfigBroker.
Sep-20-2002 jahare      Removed old JCCL network code.
Sep-15-2002 nonchocoboy ConfigChunks are now created on the fly as needed when
                        requested from a ConfigChunkDB. This allows client code
                        to follow includedesc directives before the Chunks in
                        the ConfigChunkDB try to use the chunk descs.
Sep-15-2002 patrickh    Disconnected unused JCCL network code from the build.
                        It will be replaced with the CORBA-based remote
                        reconfiguration code soon.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.9.0
Sep-14-2002 patrickh    Added an XSLT stylesheet that can upgrade configuration

                        NEW VERSION: 0.8.6
Sep-09-2002 patrickh    Added an XSLT stylesheet that can upgrade chunk
                        description files using version 2.0 of the file
                        format to version 2.1.
Aug-30-2002 nonchocoboy Removed outdated ConfigService and ConfigManagerService
                        since they have now been superceded by the
                        ConfigBroker. Made compilation of the C++ remote
                        reconfiguration code enabled by default.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.8.5
Aug-25-2002 nonchocoboy ConfigChunk property sheet now pays attention to
                        external changes to the chunk being edited. This
                        completes functionality necessary for adding/removing
                        values for variable-length properties.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.8.4
Aug-22-2002 nonchocoboy Changed the property sheet for ConfigChunks so that
                        properties (and embedded chunks) can be expanded in
                        place.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.8.3
Aug-21-2002 nonchocoboy Integrated DataSource abstraction into the ConfigBroker
                        NEW VERSION: 0.8.2
Aug-21-2002 nonchocoboy Introduced the DataSource abstraction for configuration
                        resource retrieval in VRJConfig.
Aug-20-2002 nonchocoboy Filled in the search tab of the ChunkDescChooser. This
                        completes the requirements for the ChunkDescChooser
                        dialog window.
Aug-20-2002 nonchocoboy The ConfigBroker will now popup a dialog asking the
                        user to choose a destination resource when adding a new
                        ConfigChunk or ChunkDesc if there is more than one
                        valid resource in the active context.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.8.1

                        variable-length values.
Aug-14-2002 nonchocoboy Introduced the concept of a configuration context which
                        provides a view into a subset of the open files which
                        together make up a configuration.
Aug-09-2002 patrickh    Made compilation of the C++ remote reconfiguration code
                        optional.
Aug-06-2002 patrickh    Developer installations are now constructed using the
                        standard installation targets.
Aug-02-2002 jahare      Initial version of the new C++ remote reconfiguration
                        code added.
Jul-30-2002 nonchocoboy Added ConfigBroker Tweek service to be the intermediary
                        between a view unto a configuration and the files that
                        make up that configuration.
Jul-16-2002 nonchocoboy Merged changes from jccl_tweek_conversion2_branch.
                        New ChunkDescDB editor Tweek bean created. VjControl
                        is now dead. The VRJConfig Tweek bean in the vrjuggler
                        project replaces it using the generic editing
                        components provided by JCCL.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.5.0
Jul-12-2002 patrickh    jccl::ConfigChunkDB no longer derives from std::vector.
                        jccl::ChunkDescDB no longer derives from std::map.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.4.0
Jul-02-2002 nonchocoboy New ConfigChunkDB editor edits ConfigChunks through the
                        property sheet UI model.
Jun-24-2002 patrickh    The jccl-config script is now written in Perl.  It is
                        capable of determining its installation path at
                        runtime.
Jun-19-2002 nonchocoboy ChunkDescs now have category information.
Jun-16-2002 nonchocoboy NEW VERSION: 0.3.0

                        ConfigChunks to a Tweek service.
Jun-09-2002 patrickh    Added a Python 2 script (xmlupdate.py) that can convert
                        config files created prior to version 0.2.0 to the new
                        format.
Jun-04-2002 patrickh    The process of making symlinks to the contents of
                        juggler/external/cppdom during the build process and
                        of installing CppDOM has been moved over to the
                        juggler/external mini build system.
May-31-2002 patrickh    Disabled performance collection code by default.  It is
                        currently unstable.  See SourceForge Bug #562680.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.2.1
May-24-2002 nonchocoboy Ported config subsystem to Tweek service.
May-23-2002 patrickh    Merged changes from jccl_file_format_change_branch.
            allenb      The JCCL C++ code now depends on CppDOM instead of
                        Xerces-C; the Java code depends on JDOM instead of
                        JAXP.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.2.0
May-23-2002 patrickh    Added jccl::ConfigChunk::getFullName() which returns
                        the fully qualified name of a chunk.  For child
                        chunks, the full name is the full path to the child.
May-22-2002 allenb      Updated to work with Boost 0.1.28.
May-19-2002 patrickh    Updated the ConfigUpdater utility to convert VR Juggler
                        1.0 configuration files to the second revision of the
                        XML file format.
May-13-2002 patrickh    Chunks are edited inline rather than being edited and
                        and then replaced in the chunk databases.
May-10-2002 patrickh    Chunk descriptions are edited inline rather than being
                        edited and then replaced in the description
                        databases.
May-09-2002 patrickh    Completely rewrote the loading and saving of config
                        files and chunk descriptions in VjControl.
                        Fixed the ConfigChunk Java API to match the C++ API.
May-08-2002 subatomic   Ported to cppdom.  xmlpp no longer required.
May-07-2002 patrickh    Default values are now associated with individual
                        properties.  As a result, there is no longer a
                        circular dependency between chunks and their
                        descriptions.
May-07-2002 allenb      Fix getProperty to specialize it for std::string 
                        and ChunkPtr's. I had to work around some bugs in
                        gcc's handling of member specialization, but the 
                        code is still standard so it should work on all 
                        compilers.  In the future if gcc ever fixes its 
                        implementation this code could be simplified a little.
May-06-2002 patrickh    Chunk descriptions use lower-case spellings for
                        property type identifiers.
May-06-2002 patrickh    Started work towards making config files and
                        description files case sensitive.
May-06-2002 patrickh    Finished removal of Xerces-C as a dependency.
May-06-2002 allenb      Added exception handling code for desc db load/save.
May-06-2002 allenb      Refactor to use new file format and xmlpp.
                          - Simplify config processing
                          - Remove all parsing code
                          - Use STL objects to simplify and reduce code         
                          - Replace VarValue with more general method that 
                              allows user-define types in properties
May-05-2002 allenb      Added code to config scripts to get xmlpp paths in.
May-05-2002 patrickh    Removed dependency on JAXP in favor of JDOM in the
                        Java code.
May-04-2002 patrickh    Initial support for loading and saving a version of
                        XML config files that requires no user-level parsing.
May-02-2002 allenb      Added test cases for ConfigChunk.
Apr-29-2002 nonchocoboy Modularized directory structure.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.1.0
Jan-11-2002 cjust       Made PerformanceMonitor a singleton.
Jan-08-2002 cjust       Testing equality of two "invalid" VarValues now
                        returns true.
                        Added a VarValue::isValid() convenience method.
Dec-29-2001 cjust       VjControl doesn't open multiple unsynchronized
                        copies of the same file anymore, and asks if the
                        user wants to revert to the saved copy.
Nov-30-2001 cjust       ConfigIO's API now uses const ints to explicitly
                        give the file format for reading/writing.  Most
                        callers of these APIs just use the default argument
                        for that parameter anyway, so the effect on user
                        code is small.
Oct-23-2001 cjust       Made JackalServer a singleton, allow JackalControls
                        to access its list of connections (e.g. for
                        broadcasting messages).
Oct-21-2001 cjust       Fixed registration of JackalControls.
Oct-12-2001 cjust       Updated to Allen's improved vprDebug registration
                        code.
Oct-09-2001 cjust       Optimized VjConfig.ValType to reduce number of
                        objects instatiated by configuration code.
Oct-05-2001 cjust       Replaced several explicit "parent" notifications in
                        VjControl with ActionEvent interfaces.  Cleaned up
                        message handling between the Performance module and
                        its related GUI components.
Sep-25-2001 cjust       Added various sample VjControl extensions.
Sep-20-2001 cjust       Refactored ConfigurationControl to provide a default
                        dynamic reconfiguration capability.  This should be
                        sufficient for most applications which wish to use
                        Jackal-based dynamic reconfiguration.
Sep-10-2001 cjust       Restructuring of Jackal source code & build system.
Aug-31-2001 cjust       Created the new "Jackal" module.
