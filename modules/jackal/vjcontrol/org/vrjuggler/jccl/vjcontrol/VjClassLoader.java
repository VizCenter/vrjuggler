/** URL class loader used for _all_ VjControl extension components.
 *  This is an extensible version of URLClassLoader (ie the addURL method
 *  is public).  This is used by the ComponentFactory as the ClassLoader
 *  for loading every class that occurs in VjControl extension .jars.
 *  Since all extension .jars share the same class loader, any extension
 *  .jar can access any class in any other extension .jar.
 *  <p>
 *  It is important to note that the classes in the main VjControl.jar itself
 *  are loaded by the system class loader, and therefore cannot access 
 *  classes in extension .jars unless they use the VjClassLoader directly
 *  (as is done in the ComponentFactory).
 *  
 *  @bug There is no current way to determine loader dependencies between
 *  .jar files.  For example, the VjComponents.UI classes have to be loaded
 *  before or simultaneously with any classes that use or inherit from them.
