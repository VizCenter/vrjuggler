/** Base interface for all VjComponents.
 *  VjComponents are dynamically-loadable modules which can be added to
 *  VjControl.  They can provide extensions, such as new databases or
 *  communications methods, or even new GUI components.
 *  <p>
 *  The core VjControl classes understand a small set of interfaces -
 *  VjComponent, CoreModule, etc.
 *  In addition, extension components can declare their
 *  own interfaces for extensions that they support.  For example,
 *  the VjComponents.UI package includes the ControlUIModule (the
 *  main VjControl GUI window) as well as the PlugPanel interface,
 *  which defines components that can be added to the UI window.
 *  <p>
 *  VjComponents are JavaBeans; this means that in addition to
 *  implementing a VjComponent interface, they must have a 0-argument
 *  constructor (JavaBeans should support serialization, tho VjControl
 *  does not require this).
 *  <p>
 *  Every component instance has a unique string name, and a parent
 *  component.  The parent is responsible for instantiating and 
 *  destroying its children.
 *  <p>
 *  VjControl uses Jackal-style configuration files to determine
 *  which instances of components to create.  The ConfigChunk for a
 *  component instance specifies its name, parent, and any other
 *  components it needs to perform its duties.
 *  <p>
 *  Note that, while components are usually created when VjControl
 *  processes their ConfigChunks, this is not always the case.
 *  The parent component may instead create its children on demand.
 *  The primary example of this behavior is with ConfigChunkPanel
 *  components.  These are created on-demand by the ConfigUIHelper
 *  module whenever the user wants to edit a ConfigChunk.
 *  <p>
 *  Creation of a VjComponent is a three-step process.  First, the
 *  constructor is called.  The the component is configured.  This
 *  is usually done with the VjComponent.configure() method, although
 *  the component may also provide get/set methods to configure itself
 *  (see VjComponents.ConfigEditor.ConfigurePane's usage of
 *  ChunkDBPanel for an example of where this is useful).  Finally,
 *  initialize() is called.  At this point the component should be
 *  considered "live".
 *
 *  @see ComponentFactory
 *  @version $Revision$
