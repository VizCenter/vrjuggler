tests (unit, regression, performance)

these tests should pass with no asserts (you may need to compile in debug mode)



- apps
  These are standalone test applications.  
  Usually interactive in that they cannot test themselves.
  
  
- TestSuite
  A test framework for automated tests.  
  These are usually non interactive, but can include interactive tests also.
