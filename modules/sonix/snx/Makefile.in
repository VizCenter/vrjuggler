# ABI            - Application Binary Interface type.  This may be used for
#                  other binary types when supported by the operating system
#                  (e.g., "ELF", "N32" or "64").
# ABI_LIST       - List of all possible ABI/ISA combinations that can be built
#                  on the target system.
# ISA            - Instruction Set Architecture.  This may be used for other
#                  binary types when supported by the operating system (e.g.,
#                  "mips3" or "i386").
# LIBBITSUF      - Suffix for the library path used by the linker on IRIX
#                  only.  For n32 binaries, it will be 32.  For 64-bit
#                  binaries, it will be 64.
# PLATFORM       - The operating system abbreviation on which the library is
#                  being built.
