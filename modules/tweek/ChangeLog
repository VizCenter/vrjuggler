---------- ----------- --------------------------------------------------------
2002-09-21 patrickh    Added the ability to send Beans from a C++ servant to a
                       client.  The Tweek Java GUI makes use of this so that it
                       can receive Beans easily from user code.
                       NEW VERSION: 0.12.0
2002-09-10 patrickh    Changed org.vrjuggler.tweek.net.CommunicationListener to
                       have two methods, connectionOpened() and
                       connectionClosed() instead of one method where the event
                       object determined what changed with the connection.
                       NEW VERSION: 0.11.0
2002-09-04 patrickh    Fixed bugs relating to registration of event listener
                       Beans that were not instantiated lazily by the Java GUI.
                       NEW VERSION: 0.10.3
2002-08-27 patrickh    The output from 'tweek-config --cxxflags' will include
                       -DTWEEK_HAVE_CXX=1 if the C++ API is available.
                       NEW VERSION: 0.10.2
2002-08-19 nonchocoboy Added JTreeTable component to the Tweek extensions
                       UI library as found in The Swing Connection.
                       NEW VERSION: 0.10.1
2002-08-17 nonchocoboy Added support for making beans dependent on other beans
                       in order to make sure Tweek loads the bean dependencies
                       first. This includes changes in the beanlist XML format
                       to support the new bean dependency.
                       NEW VERSION: 0.10.0
2002-08-17 patrickh    If the IRIX SPROC threading subsystem is used with VPR,
                       the C++ ABI is disabled because SPROC threads conflict
                       with omniORB.
                       NEW VERSION: 0.9.3
2002-08-16 patrickh    Fixed a bug where the paths to third-party JAR files
                       could have garbage in it when returned by running
                       'tweek-config --jars'.
2002-08-16 patrickh    Made layout adjustments in the Java GUI to improve
                       usability on IRIX.  Added the Metouia look and feel.

                       org.vrjuggler.tweek.beans.BeanPreferences.initPrefsGUI()

2002-08-13 patrickh    Added the Kunststoff Mini look and feel to the
                       collection of installed code.  This is a look and feel
                       designed for use on PDAs.
2002-08-13 patrickh    Added the Kunststoff look and feel to the collection of
                       installed code.
2002-08-11 patrickh    Changed the URL for the beanlist XML Schema to include
                       version information:
                       http://www.vrjuggler.org/tweek/xsd/1.0/beanlist.xsd
2002-08-02 patrickh    Developer installations are now constructed using the
                       standard installation targets.
2002-08-02 patrickh    Refactored the tweek::SubjectManager interface and the
                       C++ implementation to allow users to add customized

2002-07-14 patrickh    Extended org.vrjuggler.tweek.beans.FileLoader to include
                       a method for indicating that the user wants to save an
                       open file with a different name (a "Save As ..."-type
                       option).
                       NEW VERSION: 0.6.1
2002-07-14 patrickh    org.vrjuggler.tweek.gui.MessagePanel is no longer a
                       singleton.  Further, it now uses a custom document,
                       org.vrjuggler.tweek.text.MessageDocument, an
                       instance of which is held by the TweekCore singleton.
                       NEW VERSION: 0.6.0
2002-07-13 patrickh    Added a new command-line option, --validate, that
                       directs the XML loader to validate XML beanlist
                       documents against the XML Schema that describes them.
2002-07-05 nonchocoboy Added support for programmtic focusing of PanelBeans in
                       BeanModelViewers. The --defaultbean command-line
                       argument has been added.
2002-07-03 patrickh    Subject Manager servants are now named using a GUID to
                       guarantee automatic uniqueness without using a special
                       naming context.  The tweek::SubjectManager interface 
                       has been extended to provide clients with additional
                       instance-specific information about a given reference.
                       NEW VERSION: 0.5.0
2002-06-24 patrickh    The tweek-config script is now written in Perl.  It is
                       capable of determining its installation path at runtime.
2002-05-09 nonchocoboy The Bean XML files now name the Bean class rather than
                       the JAR file entry.
                       NEW VERSION: 0.4.0
2002-04-29 patrickh    Support for plugging in Java and C++ ORBs at
                       configuration time has been improved.  OpenORB and
                       omniORB 3 are still the default implementations, but it
                       is easier to use different ORBs.
2002-02-12 patrickh    The Icon Viewer now uses buttons instead of labels for
                       its icons.  This makes it much more clear when a mouse
                       click is actually being processed.
                       NEW VERSION: 0.3.1

                       closing.
                       NEW VERSION: 0.3.0

                       NEW VERSION: 0.2.0
2002-01-22 patrickh    Started a test suite for the Java code using JUnit.
2001-12-09 patrickh    Added the capability to "unregister" subjects previously
                       registered with the Subject Manager.
2001-11-20 patrickh    Created two new Java API libraries: TweekServices.jar
                       and TweekEvents.jar.
2001-11-18 patrickh    Added the ability to request all subjects currently
                       registered with a tweek::SubjectManager.
2001-11-18 patrickh    Changed the use of tweek::SubjectManagerImpl so that
                       there is one associated with each tweek::CorbaManager
                       instance rather than one per memory space.
2001-11-13 patrickh    Encourage the use of OpenORB over JDK 1.4 so that this
                       software can be used with JDK 1.2 and 1.3.
