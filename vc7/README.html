<a name="intro"><h1>1. Introduction to Compiling and Installing VR
Juggler</h1></a>

<p>
Building VR Juggler (both the C++ and the Java code) on Windows is
straightforward.  A Visual Studio solution has been created that collects
each of the redistributable entities into Visual C++ projects.  An overview
of the steps for building and installing VR Juggler on Windows follow:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Install <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> 2.2 or newer.
  </li>
  <li>
    Run <tt>buildwin32.py</tt> and fill in at least the paths to the
    required dependencies.
  </li>
  <li>
    In Visual Studio, choose the configuration(s) to build.
  </li>
  <li>
    Install the compiled libraries, tools, and (optionally) dependencies.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
Each of the above steps is described in more detail below.
</p>

<a name="install_python"><h1>2. Install Python</h1></a>

<p>
In order to <a href="#run_buildwin32_py">run the helper script
<tt>buildwin32.py</tt></a>, you must have
<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> 2.2 or newer installed on your
system.  Visit the Python website for
<a href="http://www.python.org/download/">download and install
instructions</a>.
</p>

<a name="run_buildwin32_py"><h1>3. Run <tt>buildwin32.py</tt></h1></a>

<p>
Once you have Python installed, you can open the folder containing the
Juggler Project source in Windows Explorer and double-click on the
icon for the script <tt>buildwin32.py</tt>.  This script simplifies the
process of building VR Juggler on Windows by setting up paths and
environment variables based on input that you provide.  It then starts
Visual Studio for you, and when the build is complete, it will perform
all the necessary installation steps&mdash;including installation of
VR Juggler's C++ dependencies into a convenient, centralized location.
</p>

<blockquote>
<b>NOTE:</b> For the build to work correctly, you must use the
<tt>buildwin32.py</tt> script.  It does more than just set environment
variables.
</blockquote>

<p>
Regarding the environment variables, the remainder of this
section describes each of the required and optional environment variables
used by the Visual Studio build.  You can read through them to get a
better understanding of what <tt>buildwin32.py</tt> expects from your
answers to its questions, or you can
<a href="#choose_configuration">skip to the next section</a>.
</p>

<h2>3.1. Set Environment Variables</h2>

<p>
Prior to starting the Visual Studio GUI, several environment variables
must be set.  If you run the Python script <tt>buildwin32.py</tt>, all of
the necessary environment variables will be set (and cached) based on
responses you provide to several questions.

These variables provide paths to external dependencies of the Juggler
source code.  There are some environment variables that are required for
successful compilation of the Juggler source, and there are some that are
optional for getting additional code to compile.
</p>

<h3>3.1.1. Required Environment Variables</h3>

<p>
The required environment variables are as follows:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt><tt>BOOST_ROOT</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    The root directory of an installed copy of
    <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost</a> 1.31.0 or newer.  This must
    contain a directory named <tt>lib</tt> that contains <i>at least</i>
    compiled versions of the Boost.Filesystem library.  Refer to the relevant
    <a href="http://www.boost.org/more/getting_started.html#Build_Install">Boost
    documentation</a> for instructions on how to get and install Boost.
  </dd>
  <dt><tt>BOOST_INCLUDES</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    The directory containing the root of the Boost header tree.  For a
    Boost 1.31.0 installation, this will normally be set to the value of
    <tt>%BOOST_ROOT%\include\boost-1_31</tt>.  The requirement here is
    that the value of this environment variable must be the full path to
    a directory that contains a sub-directory named <tt>boost</tt>, in
    which the Boost headers will be found.
  </dd>
  <dt><tt>BOOST_TOOL</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    The name of the Boost Jam toolset used to compile Boost.  This will
    be either <tt>vc7</tt> or <tt>vc71</tt> depending on how Boost was
    compiled.  To figure out for sure which was used, look at the names
    of the libraries in <tt>%BOOST_ROOT%\lib</tt>.  For example, the
    name of the Boost.Filesystem DLL may be
    <tt>boost_filesystem-<b>vc7</b>-mt-1_31.dll</tt> where the
    <tt>vc7</tt> part of the file name indicates that it was compiled
    using the <tt>vc7</tt> toolset.
  </dd>
  <dt><tt>BOOST_VERSION</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    The version of Boost against which the Juggler code will be compiled.
    However, this string must use underscores (<tt>_</tt>) instead of
    periods (<tt>.</tt>), and it should only reference the major and
    minor version number.  For example, if you are compiling against Boost
    1.31.2, this environment variable would be set to <tt>1_31</tt>.
  </dd>
  <dt><tt>NSPR_ROOT</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    The root directory of an installed copy of
    <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/nspr/">NSPR</a> 4.2 or newer.
    This must contain a directory named <tt>lib</tt> and a directory
    named <tt>include</tt>.
  </dd>
  <dt><tt>CPPDOM_ROOT</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    The root directory of an installed copy of
    <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/xml-cppdom/">CppDOM</a>
    0.3.2 or newer.  This must contain a directory named <tt>lib</tt> and a
    directory named <tt>include</tt>.  Within <tt>lib</tt>, there must exist
    the different builds of CppDOM: release DLL (<tt>cppdom.lib</tt> and
    <tt>cppdom.dll</tt>), debug DLL (<tt>cppddom_d.lib</tt> and
    <tt>cppdom_d.dll</tt>), static release (<tt>cppdom_s.lib</tt>), and
    static debug (<tt>cppdom_s_d.lib</tt>).
  </dd>
  <dt><tt>GMTL_ROOT</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    The root directory of an installed copy of
    <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/ggt/">GMTL</a>
    0.3.2 or newer.  This must contain a directory named <tt>include</tt>
    which in turn has a subdirectory named <tt>gmtl</tt> containing the
    GMTL header files.
  </dd>
</dl>

<a name="opt_env_vars"><h3>3.1.2. Optional Environment Variables</h3></a>

<p>
The optional environment variables are as follows:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt><tt>JAVA_HOME</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    The root directory of a <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">Java 2 SDK</a>
    installation.  It is highly recommended that version 1.4.2 or newer be
    installed.  Version 1.3.1 is the minimum required version.
  </dd>
  <dt><tt>JAVA3D_HOME</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    The root directory of a
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/">Java 3D API</a>
    installation.  Typically, this will be the same as <tt>%JAVA_HOME%</tt>,
    but that may not always be the case.  The minimum required version of
    the Java 3D API is 1.3.1.
  </dd>
  <dt><tt>PFROOT</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    The root directory of an
    <a href="http://www.sgi.com/software/performer/">OpenGL Performer</a> 3.x
    installation.  This directory must contain the sub-directories
    <tt>Include</tt> and <tt>Lib</tt>.  This is the normal structure for a
    standard OpenGL Performer installation.  This variable is normally set
    automatically by the OpenGL Performer installation wizard.
  </dd>
  <dt><tt>OMNIORB_ROOT</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    The root directory of an
    <a href="http://omniorb.sourceforge.net/">omniORB</a> 4.0.x installation.
    This directory must contain the sub-directories <tt>bin</tt>,
    <tt>include</tt>, and <tt>lib</tt>.  In <tt>bin</tt> and <tt>lib</tt>,
    there must be sub-directories named <tt>x86_win32</tt> that contain the
    actual compiled binaries.  This is the normal directory structure seen
    after omniORB is compiled successfully.
  </dd>
  <dt><tt>VRPN_ROOT</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    The root directory of a
    <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/vrpn/">VRPN</a> 6.04 or newer
    tree.  This directory must contain the sub-directories <tt>quat</tt>
    and <tt>vrpn</tt>.  In each of those, there must be a sub-directory
    named <tt>pc_win32</tt>, and within it, there must be sub-directories
    named <tt>Debug</tt> and <tt>Release</tt>.  These contain the compiled
    version of the appropriate library.  This is the normal directory
    structure seen after VRPN is compiled successfully.
  </dd>
  <dt><tt>AUDIERE_ROOT</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    The root directory of an
    <a href="http://audiere.sourceforge.net/">Audiere</a> 1.9.3 or newer
    installation.
  </dd>
  <dt><tt>TRACKD_API_ROOT</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    The root directory of a Trackd API installation.
  </dd>
</dl>

<a name="choose_configuration"><h1>4. Choose a Configuration to Build</h1></a>

<p>
After you answer the questions asked by <tt>buildwin32.py</tt>, the script
will start up the version of Visual Studio that you have in your path (or
that it detected on your system if your environment does not have the
<tt>devenv.exe</tt> command in your path).  Inside the Visual Studio GUI,
you must choose the configuration that you want to build.
</p>

<p>
The chosen target should be either "Debug DLL" or "Release DLL".  Otherwise,
select "Batch Build" under the "Build" menu and compile everything all at
once.  If you choose to build everything but do not have all the
<a href="#opt_env_vars">optional dependencies</a>, some optional targets
such as device drivers or Java features may fail to build.  If this is not
acceptable, you must <a href="#run_buildwin32_py">go back to Step 3</a>
and run <tt>buildwin32.py</tt> again.
</p>

<a name="install_vrj"><h1>5. Install VR Juggler</h1></a>

<p>
After successfully compiling VR Juggler, <tt>buildwin32.py</tt> will ask
if you want to install VR Juggler.  On Windows, you must install VR Juggler
to be able to build and run applications.  Working out of the development
tree is not possible the way it is on other platforms.  If you answer
"yes" to the question of installing VR Juggler, <tt>buildwin32.py</tt> will
go through the full process of installing everything that was compiled.
</p>

<a name="install_deps"><h1>6. Install VR Juggler Dependencies</h1></a>

<p>
After VR Juggler is installed, you will be given the option to install
VR Juggler's C++ dependencies.  This includes NSPR, CppDOM, Boost, GMTL,
and any optional packages that were available for compiling additional
features.  If you answer "yes" to this question, the dependencies will
be installed to a location of your choice (which can be the same as the
VR Juggler installation directory).  This gives you a convenient,
single location for referencing all dependencies from application project
files.
</p>

<blockquote>
<b>NOTE:</b> The sample and test applications reference the environment
variable <tt>%VJ_DEPS_DIR%</tt>, so it is highly recommended that you
install the dependencies to a single location unless you have already done
so.
