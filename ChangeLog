DATE        AUTHOR    CHANGE
----------- --------- ---------------------------------------------------------
[Version 1.0.3 - 11.26.2001]===================================================
Nov-16-2001 allenb    Fixed memory bug in aMotionStar.
Nov-15-2001 cjust     Resolved VjControl problems with Java 1.4 caused by
                      changes to the JDK's JComboBox semantics.
Oct-28-2001 cjust     Patched to prevent errors caused by device drivers
                      not overriding getPosUpdateTime.
Oct-17-2001 kevn      Fixed bug where vjGetVjMatrix returns the wrong 
                      conversion.
Aug-29-2001 patrick   We build shared libraries on HP-UX 11.x now (submitted by
                      Daniel Heath <DHeath@fueltechnv.com>).

[Version 1.0.2 - 8.6.2001]=====================================================
Jul-24-2001 cjust     Fixed a redraw bug in VjControl that happened when
                      updating the Active chunkdb from a network connection.
                      This could cause the status bar label or the chunkdb's
                      JTree to be shifted to the upper-left corner of the
                      VjControl window.
Jul-05-2001 patrick   Fixed the TrackdSensor and TrackdController chunk
                      descriptions so that min and max are correctly listed
                      with TrackdController.
Jun-28-2001 patrick   The POSIX thread wrapper no longer calls pthread_exit(3)
                      in its destructor.  For stack-allocated vjThread objects
                      (using pthreads), this caused the wrong thread to exit
                      when the object went out of scope.

[Version 1.0.1 - 6.14.2001]====================================================
Jun-13-2001 patrick   Added a script called juggler-config that users can run
                      to get compiler and linker options needed for building
                      against VR Juggler
May-29-2001 patrick   Fixed a major bug in the MotionStar driver that was
                      preventing proper system configuration when the server
                      was in a bad state
May-17-2001 patrick   Added support for HP-UX 11.00 (submitted by Daniel Heath
                      <DHeath@fueltechnv.com>)

[Version 1.0.0 - 4.13.2001]====================================================
Apr-13-2001 patrick   Polhemus Fastrack driver added (IRIX SPROC only)
Apr-12-2001 patrick   The MotionStar driver now supports setting the
                      measurement rate
Mar-28-2001 kevn      vjQuat::unit() is now vjQuat::normalizeFast()
                      vjQuat::makeQuat() is now vjQuat::makeRot()
Feb-14-2001 cjust     Fixed VjControl problems with recognizing backspace
                      on linux.
Feb-07-2001 patrick   The extra VR Juggler data files, sample applications,
                      sample config files, etc. now install in
                      $VJ_BASE_DIR/share by default.  This includes the
                      basic chunk description file, so local vjcontrol.cfg
                      files must be updated.  The easiest way to do this is
                      to change the descfiles property to have the value
                      "$VJ_SHARE_DIR/Data/chunksDesc".  VjControl knows how to
                      expand $VJ_SHARE_DIR on its own.
Jan-27-2001 patrick   The Juggler_utils library must now be linked for all
                      applications.
Jan-26-2001 cjust     Improved Navigation in VjControl help.
Jan-20-2001 cjust     VjControl now recommends JDK1.3 (1.2 still minimum).
Jan-09-2001 patrick   RELENG_1_0 CVS branch created in preparation for 1.0
                      release.  The branch point is the same as for RELENG_0_2,
                      and all changes on RELENG_0_2 were merged onto this
                      branch.  RELENG_0_2 is now dead.
Jan-04-2001 kevn      vjSingleton is a little more robust now:
                      fixed a case where you could create one before it's
                      static data member was initialized.  Moved this static
                      data member to static function data to ensure init
                      when instance() is called.  The is one more bug/issue
                      and that is the problem that static local function data
                      is not thread safe.  This appears only when ThreadManager
                      has not been initialized/accessed yet.
                      This could cause two simultaneous calls to instance() to
                      try to access the thread manager, and one will recieve a
                      NULL mutex. 
Dec-18-2000 bthomp    UNIX version of IS-900 driver converted to use termios
                      which in turn fixes cross-platform building
Dec-13-2000 patrick   RELENG_0_2 CVS branch created in preparation for 0.2.0
                      release
Nov-27-2000 bthomp    Added initial version of Intersense IS-900 driver
Nov-02-2000 patrick   Finished new MotionStar driver--config files must be
                      updated to reflect some new options

Aug-29-2000 allenb    Fixed bug with Performer calling app traversals
                      once per channel.

Aug-05-2000 patrick   Now using std namespace for all C++ I/O
Aug-03-2000 patrick   -LANG:std is now used when compiling on IRIX
Jul-18-2000           VR Juggler 0.1.97 released

[Version 0.1.97 - 7.19.2000]===================================================
Jul-13-2000 cjust     Environment Manager works under NT
                      Config files can have includes for chunkdesc files
                      Config file includes now use relative paths correctly
                      Vjcontrol fixes for editing embedded chunks
                      Vjcontrol internal event architecture expanded
                      Vjcontrol componentization (partial)

Jul-07-2000 patrick   Debugging symbols are now compiled into object files on
                      Win32 which fixes long-standing (but unreported)
                      problems with linking Juggler applications.
Jun-29-2000 cjust     Java 1.1 compatability has been dropped from VjControl
Jun-23-2000 patrick   Set the stereo bit in an OpenGL window on Win32 if
                      stereo is enabled in the windwo's config chunk.
                      _OLD_TERMIOS is no longer set on IRIX.  The serial
                      drivers are using the latest termios functions.  This
                      code will probably not work on versions of IRIX before
                      6.5 as a result.
                      Added the new utility library Juggler_utils which is
                      required by most, if not all, applications after this
                      date.
Jun-17-2000 kevn      SoundManager added, juggler sound engine for audioworks 
                      is available.
