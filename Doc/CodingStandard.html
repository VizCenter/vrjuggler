Coding Standard</H1></CENTER>
The following link has a good desciption of a coding standard and why one
is needed:
<BR><A HREF="http://www.possibility.com/Cpp/CppCodingStandard.html">http://www.possibility.com/Cpp/CppCodingStandard.html</A>

<P>The coding standard for VR Juggler will be based on a simplified version
of the above standard.&nbsp; The standard will be minimal and still try
to allow for flexibility.&nbsp; We just need a way to make the source code
readably and maintainable across all classes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H4>
Documentation</H4>
We will be using a modified PERCEPS script to automatically create documentation.&nbsp;
In order to allow for this, the source code must be commented with this
in mind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H4>
&nbsp;Code Standard</H4>
The following is a brief summary of the way the code in VR Juggler should
be written.&nbsp; Of course there are always various exceptions, but if
the code is relatively consistent it will make it much easier for us all.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H4>
Names</H4>

<UL>
<LI>
Class Names:&nbsp; Name the class after what it does</LI>

<LI>
Method Names: Name it after the actions it does</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
Suffixes are sometimes useful:</LI>
</UL>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Max - to mean the maximum value
something can have.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cnt - the current count
of a running count variable.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Key - key value.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example: RetryMax to mean the maximum number
of retries, RetryCnt to mean the current
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; retry count.
<UL>
<LI>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prefixes are sometimes useful:</LI>
</UL>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is - to ask a question about
something. Whenever someone sees Is they will know it's a question.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get - get a value.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set - set a value.</UL>
