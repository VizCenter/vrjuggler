//-------------------------------------
//: Communications and configuration agent
//
//      The Environment Manager handles communications between
//      Juggler and UI elements.  This includes data logging and
//      interactive connections to the VR Juggler control program,
//      vjControl.
//      The EM's most important function is to communicate 
//      configuration information and changes between the GUI and
//      the Kernel.  It is also the owner and manager of Juggler
//      Performance measurement code.
//      A near-future addition will be device status/data monitoring.
// 
//      Which means that its main duties are:
//         - handle file and socket connections
//         - handle vjPerfDataBuffers
