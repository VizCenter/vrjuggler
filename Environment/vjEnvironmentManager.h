// The Environment Manager handles network connections to 
// UI components.
// Which means that its main duties are:
//   - create a socket
//   - spin off a process to listen() for connections
//   - spin off a process to handle an active connection
//
// the above assumes we want to allow multiple connections 
// at once.  I'm not sure if that's neccessary, but its 
// probably best to design with that idea in mind.  We 
// might end up with separate monitors & stuff.
