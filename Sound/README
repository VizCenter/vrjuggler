SoundEngine: Abstraction for multiple sound API's.
Contact: Kevin Meinert or the VR Juggler team at http://www.vrjuggler.org

Purpose: To get people to use sound more in their VR apps - since it's
nearly impossible when the license restricts you to one machine.

Caveats: The Aw classes runs on Audioworks machines only... how barfy
SL is 8 bit mono with 3 sound polyphony..  also barfy.
OpenAL doesn't work on IRIX yet.
Read the TODO file for other limitations.
