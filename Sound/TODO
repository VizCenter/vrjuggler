get OpenAL working on IRIX.....
write the OpenAL wrapper.


[5.10.2000]

lots...


use some standard config file format such as XML or VRJuggler's configchunks.
  (this would mean splitting out juggler's config chunks first...)
  
not all things are supported such as looping of sounds, enable etc..

this lib implements only a limited subset of the each sound api... expand it.
