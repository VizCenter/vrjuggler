//---------------------------------------------------------------
//: temporary storage for performance data
//
// Problem: gathering up the performance data and shipping it out
//          to wherever should happen independently of the 
//          process that's generating the data.
// <p>
// Solution: the vjPerfDataBuffer is used as a temporary storage
//           for perfdata.  Each unit in the buffer contains
//           an integer index and a timestamp. the index is used
//           in case there are multiple points inside the 
//           process body where timestamps are generated
//           (i.e. 1 = start of frame, 2 = before sync, 
//           3 = between sync and buffer swap.
// <p>
// One process can write to the buffer (using the set() fn) 
// while another simultaneously reads from it using the 
// write() function.  The system is implemented so that the
// writing process never has to wait.  However, this means 
// that if the writer gets far enough ahead of the reader 
// that there are no more free buffers, the PerfDataBuffer
// will start throwing away data until there is a free buffer.
// The 'lost' field approximates the number of data samples
// lost; it is reported and reset at the conclusion of every
// write() call.
