    //+       between different stamping points in the process
    //+       that calls set. e.g. 1 = point right before

    //+       used again by the writer.
    //! ARGS: out - an ostream to write contents to.
    //! NOTE: The format for a buffer is 'ind timestamp\n',
    //+       e.g.: (for four buffers, say we have 3 indices)
    //+       <br>1 15
